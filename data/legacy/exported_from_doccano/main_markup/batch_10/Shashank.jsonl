I assume then you've heard of Save the Children and the great work they do with young people?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I've heard of it. Can you please explain more about it?\nPersuader: Firstly, they provide funds and support services to help protect vulnerable children all over the world. Once the children have a safe environment the next priority is to improve their lives via education and other resources. They really make a difference to the lives of children in poverty or destitution.\n\tPersuadee: I am interested in it. I already checked their website. Health and education both are important factors\nPersuader: Absolutely. And the great thing for us is that even a very small donation goes a long way due to the number of people who can donate! We're asking people today to give a small part of the payment for this HIT to the charity. You'll get a box pop up at teh end of our chat which will give you the opportunity to donate something. Obviously the more the better, but I also appreciate that you aren't turking for free so you can judge it yourself.\n\tPersuadee: Actually I like these kind of HITs. I did few HITs before that asked me to donate my bonus or half of the reward. I happily did. I am sure there are people who need it more than me\nPersuader: You're absolutely right-  sometimes we don't realise it, but what seems like a little bit of moeny to us can make a big difference to them. I worked in Africa earlier this year and the difference a few dollars can make to people over there is unbelievable.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, few dollars can save a child or can help a family to survive for a month. How long have you worked there?\nPersuader: I'm back in the UK now - I was in South Africa (Durban) for three months from January to end of March for work.\n\tPersuadee: That is so nice of you. It is a big thing to do. Thinking about starving children makes me so sad. I wish I could do more\nPersuader: We can all do something - donate a little bit or volunteer to try to help. There are lots of opportunities\n\tPersuadee: Yes you are right, I help as much as I can. at least I try. \"save the children\" sounds like an amazing organization. They work in 120 countries already\nPersuader: They certainly do and tehy are well established so you cna be certain they are going to use the money in a good way.\n\tPersuadee: Yes It looks like a trustworthy organization with no doubt. I already read few of their reports on their website. I wish they can help even more countries\nPersuader: Me too.

What is the process of becoming one of the instructors?\nPersuader: ALL INSTRUCTORS MUST SPEAK TWO LANGUAGES AND HAVE TWO YEARS OF FORMAL TEACHING.  THEY CAN THEN APPLY TO A SPECIFIC MISSION AS THEY COME UP, USUALLY 6 MONTHS AHEAD OF THE START DATE.\n\tPersuadee: I imagine it's pretty hard to go overseas for so long in a different country. What kind of experience have the prior instructors had? \nPersuader: MANY HAVE LOVED IT ALTHOUGH IT CAN BE CHALLENGING, THE INSTRUCTORS ARE PAID VERY LITTLE BUT GIVEN FREE ROOM/BOARD.  HOWEVER AFTER ONE YEAR OF WORK THEY CAN APPLY THRU A SPECIAL PROGRAM TO BE CITIZENS OF THE HOST COUNTRY.\n\tPersuadee: That's a really cool deal.

I would rather donate a lower amount than $1 if we decide on donating anything at all\nPersuader: why are you not comfortable? Is it that you  cannot afford to? Or you don't know the charity Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I can not afford. I believe we should help ourselves before reaching out to others in need. Additionally, I don't know what exactly Save the Children is using this money for\nPersuader: It is just a dollar, geeze.  As I mentioned they are using it to help children who are starving, injured or who have lost their parents. You can look up the charity to see they are legitimate.\n\tPersuadee: In my opinion, every dollar counts. Unless I get to see with my own eyes what the charity is doing, then I don't know if they are legitimate or not\nPersuader: You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment. I would donate $2 because I know there are a lot of kids out there who need the help and to me, $2 is nothing\n\tPersuadee: I choose to donate $0 then\nPersuader: Wow, pathetic, do you have kids?\n\tPersuadee: No, I don't have kids. Please respect my decision\nPersuader: I hope you don't consider yourself to be a Christian, the hypocrisy would be laughable\n\tPersuadee: I have no idea why you chose to put religion into this. I am not religious and your decision to bring Christianity into this is ignorant", "label": [[47, 142, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [11, 20, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [413, 563, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [776, 858, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [747, 775, "2-NEGOTIATE-REMIND"], [1046, 1079, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1080, 1128, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [200, 284, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"], [285, 349, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [402, 411, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [603, 649, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1017, 1045, "7-RESSURE-OTHER"], [1326, 1353, "7-PRESSURE-PRESIST"], [1355, 1462, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1463, 1518, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1690, 1744, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1745, 1854, "6-SOCIAL-PEER"], [2011, 2097, "7-PRESSURE-MANIPULATE"], [1905, 1937, "7-PRESSURE-MANIPULATE"]], "idx": "519"}

They really make an impact to help improve the lives of children around the world.\n\tPersuadee: That is very interesting, Are they clear with their financial reports? I mean is it a trustworthy organization?\nPersuader: Yes, a very trustworthy organization. I've donated to them in the past and I'm very happy with the results\n\tPersuadee: good, is it an international organization or they just focus on one or few countries?\nPersuader: They focus on countries all around the world. Do you think you would be able to donate a small portion of your earnings today to the organization?\n\tPersuadee: Sure I will be able to donate. I've been able to donate through MTurk. It makes me feel useful.\nPersuader: That's great to hear. I assure you that your donation will make a difference.\n\tPersuadee: I am sure too, a little help can really make a big difference. It is surprising that even $30.00 per month can support a whole family\nPersuader: Yes, I've even heard where a $1 donation can make a difference. It is important, however, to make sure the organization is on the up and up\n\tPersuadee: Yes and It is interesting how donating by HITs sometimes won't even hurt the payment. It is like they do it on their behalf\nPersuader: Yes, I've come across that as well. Fortunately any little bit can help\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I also like when I see big charities cooperate with big companies. I like it when part of my purchase will be donated\nPersuader: Ah yes, that's always a nice benefit as well. I'm glad you chose to donate\n\tPersuadee: I am glad too, is there any website that i can read more about this organization and use it if i want to donate later again?\nPersuader: Yes,  URL is the official website for the organization\n\tPersuadee: thank you so much, I will take the time to read about it", "label": [[698, 766, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [922, 1022, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [1700, 1735, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [11, 81, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [182, 270, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [327, 524, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [660, 697, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [876, 921, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1142, 1163, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1164, 1219, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1377, 1516, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1664, 1699, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1882, 1927, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1928, 1956, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [2105, 2159, "8-NO-PERSUASION"]], "idx": "520"}

You see, this organization is in desperate need of donations. I was hoping I could possibly persuade you into making a donation? This is for a great cause, after all I feel as though we need to do what we can in order to help other's around the world, especially ones that are in desperate need of our help - don't you agree? \n\tPersuadee: Sure I could agree with that, children are the future so we should do what we can to ensure theirs.\nPersuader: Excellent, great to hear! How much would you like to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount, from 0$ to all of your payment with the total of 2$. Any amount would be helpful, though an amount of 2$ may be small to us - we could buy candy, or something we can easily get whenever we want but to the kids, this could be a lifesaver, so every penny counts!\n\tPersuadee: Ok so how will it work if I decide to done a portion?  The researchers will take care of it?\nPersuader: Yes, you have nothing to worry about. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the children.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds fair, is save the children government sponsored?\nPersuader: No, it is a non-govermental organization that helps promote children's rights, providing relief and helps support children in developing countries. Which I think is amazing, how selfless are the people who came up with this? I just know that donating a small bit of money can really help them get one step closer to their goals. So, have you decided on the amount you'd like to donate?\n\tPersuadee: Almost, do you happen to know if their work is world-wide or only focused on developing countries?\nPersuader: As I stated before, it is set up to support children within developing countries. Hopefully one day it will be world- wide.

{"id": 2700, "data": "Persuader: How important do you think it is to donate to charities? Especially charities that help children?\n\tPersuadee: I feel as if it is important to give back to society and help out charities when you can.  I think that children are an important aspect in our society as they are the future and will be the worlds next leaders.  Is there one particular one that you favor?\nPersuader: Have you heard of Save the Children - They do really amazing work with kids locally and globally. I like that they don't just focus on one thing, they prioritize all aspects of improving a child's life\n\tPersuadee: I have not heard of them before.  Would you say they want to focus on the children and improving their lives as a whole?\nPersuader: Yeah definitely. They work with hunger - helping to reduce the amount of children who die from malnutrition as well as helping to support kids in war zones from violence. They do a lot of disaster relief - After the flooding in Texas last year they did a ton of work to help kids there. They also support head start organizations, and provide backpacks and back to school supplies in under served communities \n\tPersuadee: Wow that is really neat, it sounds like they are on par with some of the bigger organizations.  They must have a lot of resources.  Have you been involved with them in the past?\nPersuader: I think they have a lot of support from donors big and small. They are one of the charities that I like to support when able. Do you feel like people who have the ability are usually pretty likely to donate to a charity like this?\n\tPersuadee: I do feel like that they are as it is an admirable non profit.  If you could dontate today with the payment how much woud you donate?\nPersuader: I would donate the whole payment. I think sometimes we forget how much impact a microdonation can have. It seems like a small amount to us, but even that 0.30 can have an impact on someones life. What about you?\n\tPersuadee: I think that a microdonation is appropriate and would agree with you that a .30 cent donation would be appropriate.  No matter how little it is, it eventually adds up and can still impact someones life.  So can it be concluded that we could agree to donate .30?\nPersuader: Yes, I think so. .30 can add up quickly and stretch a lot further through an organization like this than one might think\n\tPersuadee: Agreed, despite how small it may be, I think they would greatly appreciate it.  I would feel comfortable making a microdonation to help them out no matter how small.  Are there any other non profits you normally are involved with?\nPersuader: I also really like March of Dimes and St Jude - I guess I have a soft spot for charities that help children as their primary goal\n\tPersuadee: I have not had too many encounters with them, are you familiar with Mission 22, a npo for veterans?\nPersuader: I have not heard of that one. What does it do?\n\tPersuadee: Its a non profit designed for veterans and mental health.  They work to provide mental health services for veterans suffering from PTSD and other mental health problems stemming from their time in the military.\nPersuader: That is really awesome! I will have to look into that one further. I don't think there is enough support in that area. Thank you for sharing that one!\n\tPersuadee: It has been a great organization and its headed by many people as it has become a huge problem.  Despite that however, I think that for today we should commit .30 for the Save the Children for today. \nPersuader: I agree .30 is the right choice\n\tPersuadee: With that being said, thank you for working with me, I greatly appreciate it and I am glad we were able to both make a micro donation.

Are you aware of the non-profit Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: oh yeah. my wife is a social worker way back to the philippines and that is one of her job\nPersuader: Excellent.  In that case then you are aware of the suffering many children are enduring due to food shortages, natural disasters, and war zones.  There are kids sleeping in the streets even here in the U.S.  These kids need our help. Fortunately, there is something we can do about it.\n\tPersuadee: yeah the Government have to do something to help the children having their safe place to live\nPersuader: I completely agree.  Sadly, most government agencies that are supposed to provide this support are often staffed by corrupt or greedy management.  This leaves the task to our non-profits to help as many children as possible.  Would you like to know more about Save the Children?  Any questions I can answer?\n\tPersuadee: oh yeah im agree with that. but as an individual we can still help them thru giving them food something like that and or try calling the social welfare office to help the street children by having a safe shelter on there place\nPersuader: Indeed we can!  And every action counts when it comes to these kids' quality of life.  While we can work individually toward our goal, it is often helpful to work with others toward a common goal.

{"id": 2710, "data": "Persuader: hey :) Today I\\'m representing an organization called \"Save the Children\", an international group that aims to provide aid to children\n\tPersuadee: Save them from what?\nPersuader: from poverty and from disaster mostly. If you choose to donate money, it goes to providing food to impoverished children\n\tPersuadee: I can think of a lot more worthwhile charities.\nPersuader: That may be true, but Save the Children has been recognized as reliable by charity rater. Additionally, this one has a high percentage of money raised going directly to helping support the cause. hundreds of thousands of children are dying every week due to lack of food\n\tPersuadee: There are three kinds of charities I never donate to:   children, diseases and veterans\nPersuader: Maybe this could be an exception for you then? I can understand your reasoning, but famine is a huge problem especially right now. More crop harvests are failing reducing the already low amount of food to near-nothing\n\tPersuadee: Maybe thats nature limiting overpopulation.\nPersuader: True, although higher populations in famine-ridden countries are necessary. There needs to be more people that are able to farm. Additionally, it's good karma. Every cent helps\n\tPersuadee: my cents go to worthwhile charities not the ones in those three categories.\nPersuader: That's understandable. What would you consider a worthwhile charity?\n\tPersuadee: Homeless shelters, food pantries, environmental stuff....\nPersuader: Food pantries? A lot of food worldwide comes from countries such as Zimbabwe or Haiti (countries that work with Save the Children). Right now there's famine, but by donating it will ultimately increase the worldwide food, and reduce the need for food pantries as a whole. Even though it's marketed at children, it's moreso helping the areas that have a high child poverty rate\n\tPersuadee: There are too many children.  \nPersuader: Makes sense, but countries like Italy or Japan are experiencing a population shift. Even in countries like USA and France, more doctors and scientists are retiring than graduating. So we need kids to supplement all of those areas\n\tPersuadee: There are probably less doctors because the education is expensive not because there aren't enought children\nPersuader: In France tuition is not as expensive as in USA. There is a lack of population from 18-24, and there's even less of a population below 15. In Japan, the birthrate is low so keeping children is key as the population retires more. Children are the future work force, and help countries run economically and socially. By supporting this charity you would directly be supporting your future\n\tPersuadee: It sounds like nature is taking care of overpopulation.  I applaud that.\nPersuader: A lot of the time it isn't necesarrily overpopulation. In the case of Syria, there's a widespread civil war. Within the first quarter of 2018, over 1000 children were murdered by both sides. Save the Children has a mission to get as many children out of there as possible, because their heads are being used as trophies. It's sick and financial donation is the best way to help besides going there yourself\n\tPersuadee: Maybe the war is taking care of overpopulation.  Perhaps I should rethink my opinion on war.\nPersuader: That's understandable. So you're not interested in donation at all?

All I can afford is $5.00.\nPersuader: I think that is an excellent amount and would benefit Save the Children.

Your donation means a lot to that child in India\n\tPersuadee: It is the least I can do for him.

That is why I donate what I can to organizations like Save the Children. As you may know, Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Are there any organizations that you can reccomend?\n\tPersuadee: I sponsor through World Vision. I like them because they are very transparent about where the money is going. You can see photos and videos of your sponsor child and his or her community. And they let you know what type of progress is occuring both with your child and the community in general. It is so satisfying to know you are making a real difference in someone's life, and maybe in many lives.\nPersuader: I cannot thank you enough for that. How much do you donate on average annually?\n\tPersuadee: Well it's $39 a month, so $468 annually. I also send him little care packages every so often. At Christmas I plan to send either $100 or $200 as a special gift to his family, which will enable them to buy a goat, some chickens, etc. That will have such a big impact on their lives. \nPersuader: Wow, that is very thoughtful of you. You go the extra mile for that child and I know he appreciates everything that you do for him. How much do you like to donate to the charity now?\n\tPersuadee: Well, I know I said $5, but I think I will make it $10.\nPersuader: I appreciate that and rest assured, your donation today will make an impact for children around the world.

Have you every heard of this charity before?\n\tPersuadee: Yep, sure have! Tell me more\nPersuader: Sure thing! Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. Millions of children around the world have grown up in less than ideal scenarios so the mission of the charity is to help them get what they need.\n\tPersuadee: That's great to hear! Have you donated to it before?\nPersuader: I personally have not but they do very good things and I am definitely considering making a donation sometime in the future.\n\tPersuadee: Nice! Maybe i can donate too in the future\nPersuader: Yes you should definitely consider it! In fact, you can donate to the charity right now if you'd like to.\n\tPersuadee: Yea? How do i do it?\nPersuader: It's really simple! All you have to do is tell me how much you'd like to donate and it will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose from any amount from $0 to all of your payment.\n\tPersuadee: Cool! Sounds good\nPersuader: Awesome! We do need to get to 10 minimum chat turns so feel free to think about it some more. Let me know if you would like any more information.\n\tPersuadee: Tell me more, please.

One of the main focuses of the charity is to help children in Middle Eastern and African countries. Children in these areas have been heavily affected by war and famine and in Syria specifically millions of children have grown up facing a daily threat of violence. Your donation can help these refugee children which is very important because half of all refugees are children.\n\tPersuadee: Sounds good to me. I think i will make a donation now.

How do I know my money will go where it supposed to?\nPersuader: They're a world-famous trustworthy charity. If they were fraudulent or misallocating funds, surely there'd have been a scandal.\n\tPersuadee: Ok. So why do they deserve my money as opposed to other charities like St Judes or the Red Cross>\nPersuader: Of course you can donate to other charities. It's not necessarily a zero-sum game. I can tell you, however, that Save the Children is, in a way, more immediate in helping people (as opposed to fighting disease like St Jude's) and delivers services similar to the Red Cross, but directed toward children. So, please: think of the children!\n\tPersuadee: Do they help kids in the US? I like to help people that are close to home.\nPersuader: Their assistance is directed toward children in developing countries, where, unlike most of the US, children are totally deprived of opportunity and basic services. Though you, being the generous person you are, like helping those at home, is there a reason not to help children abroad?\n\tPersuadee: I don't mind helping those abroad. But there are a lot kids here in the US who deal with poverty.  So it's not that I don't care about the children elsewhere, just want to help those at home first.\nPersuader: So we'll agree then: you can do both!\n\tPersuadee: Well how do i make a donation to them?\nPersuader: You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to: http:// URL \n\tPersuadee: well if you aren't going to help me out with information and make it easy on me by helping with info, i'm not sure if you really care\nPersuader: Of course I care.

It ensures childrens right to health, education and so on.  Do you ever volunteer or make donations?\n\tPersuadee: I'll be honest with you, I have made donations to children's charities in the past. Like when I was in my twenties, but these days I have only made donations to animal rescue groups within the past two years. It's a very long story that begins with me witnessing a severe animal abuse (cats) case in my town.  \nPersuader: You are an amazing person for caring for these  babies.  Animals are like children.  In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.  Save the Children is an amazing organization.\n\tPersuadee: How were these children killed or injured -- because I know that many people (children too) are slaughtered on the highway in horrific road accidents.  If Save the Children helps those children who are orphaned or injured like this, then it is an amzing organization.Is that what this applies to?\nPersuader: The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.\n\tPersuadee: I watched a video on YouTube a couple of years ago. It was Syrian children in a classroom, they were coloring pictures. It completely broke my heart because of their precious sweet innocence and intelligence.  Their lives were in danger constantly from the threat of terrorism.\nPersuader: It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.  It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day. \n\tPersuadee: Me too. I think about the little face I saw and since it was so long ago, I wonder if each and every one is okay -- still alive. \nPersuader: Making a small donation today will indeed help children and their families in such sad situations.  Would you be willing to donate from your task payment today?\n\tPersuadee: Absolutely. I hope everyone does.\nPersuader: I most definitely agree.   How much will you be donating today?\n\tPersuadee: Whatever my task payment will be. I have no money right now which is why I'm on Mturk tonight. I live with my parents and I just bought a car last week which caused me an overdraft which I won't be caught up on until this coming Friday. \nPersuader: I completely understand that.

With all the organizations out there it is hard to tell a good one and a bad one. This organization helps to children with their rights to health, education, and even safety.\n\tPersuadee: Yes it is hard to tell whose interests really lie in the movement they promote. I like to research organizations first to see if the money I give is really going to the cause, or if it is wasted by high overhead costs. \nPersuader: Yeah I totally understand that. I know the commercials are heart wrenching...seeing all those children suffer and hurting. It breaks my heart. \n\tPersuadee: Absolutely.

They use almost 90% of all donations directly to help children in the areas of education, safety and emergency...\n\tPersuadee: That's good to know that almost 90 percent of all donations go directly to help children. We know it's a problem not just in the United States. \nPersuader: Yes, exactly. I'm not a fan of charities that keep a lot of their proceeds for themselves. That's one reason I really like this one. Do you think you would be willing to make a small donation to Save the Children today?\n\tPersuadee: I most likely will. I would like to read some more information, probably on their website, then donate from there. How do they help children in other parts of the world?\nPersuader: Well, I know that the research team for this task can take a portion of our payment and send it directly to the Save the Children.

Tell me a little about it.\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Thats awesome! How do you know the money I donate will reach them?\nPersuader: Ok, well out of all the money you donate, 86 percent goes to actually programs to help them (which is alot) 9 percent is rolled back in to fundraising and 5 percent is used for miscellaneous expenditures. These numbers are really good when compared to other charities\n\tPersuadee: Oh yeah thats good. How does my money get to the charity from here?\nPersuader: The research team will collect all or any donations and send it to the Save the Children. There are thousands of children out there depending on these donation so it is imperative to get them their help as quick as possible. \n\tPersuadee: Okay that sounds good. I will donate.\nPersuader: How much would you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

I cant guarantee where exactly the money will go, but where would you like to see it go?\n\tPersuadee: I would hope it would go to food, water, clothing, or education for those children less fortunate thank my own.\nPersuader: Yes those would be great places to go. You know it will also go to children in places like Syria where 1000 have been reported killed or injured in 2018 alone. Sad stuff. \n\tPersuadee: I can't imagine how bad it is over there. It's tragic the amount of people and especially children that are dying.\nPersuader: Yes indeed, thats why organizations like Save the Children are so important in relief for these children. Are there any other questions on the donation?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I do not need to do anything further for the donation, right? \nPersuader: No you will be prompted at the end by the research team and they will take care of the donation.

We try to actually know people involved before we give regularly.\nPersuader: That\\'s awesome and such an important step. Have you ever heard of \"Save the Children\"?

They sounds like a great charity from what I know.  We do something similar by sponsoring a child from an Ethiopian orphanage we visited.  What was your experience being in Greece like?  I don't think of it as being high risk...\nPersuader: Actually, many Greek refugee camps are rated as as-bad or worse than many camps in war zones. It's complete chaos, overrun by gangs and gang violence, and often lacking in basic hygiene and access to clean water or food. Women are frequently raped while trying to use the toilets (which are horrendous) and rats run amok among the tents. One of the children we were working with had a huge rat bite on her foot and many of them had fled to Greece on their own. \n\tPersuadee: Wow!  Did you feel safe?  What could you do to help?  \nPersuader: It was nuts - we even had a neo-Nazi mob hunting us in the streets one night. I definitely did not feel safe there. We tried to do our best to get kids registered and provide English classes and some amount of regularity for them. Save the Children created a space just for kids and mothers and were able to assist with getting them into school\n\tPersuadee: What an amazing experience!  That kind of thing shapes your life!  \nPersuader: Well, yeah, but it's much more important to address the things shaping the lives of these children. That's why I think it's so important to donate to Save the Children. Even if we can't always be there, they are making the effort everyday\n\tPersuadee: Do you still keep in touch with people over there?  Do you donate directly?\nPersuader: I do donate directly, not just to Save the Children, but to several other organizations as well. I still have friends working over there. This HIT we're doing has offered to donate some of our income to the charity. I always take MTurk requesters up on it when they ask us to donate our earnings. I mean, other people can use the $2 more than me, right? \n\tPersuadee: For sure!  Our money can do a long way!  I can donate my 30 cents!\nPersuader: Hey, that's awesome! Actually you're allowed to donate anywhere from $0-$2, not just your 30 cents! It's completely up to you. Once we decide to donate then they'll send the payment to Save the Children\n\tPersuadee: I'll do 30 cents.  We actually give over 25% of our income away, but that's because we research and really KNOW the organizations.  I don't have a personal connection to Save the Children, like I do with the child in Ethiopia.\nPersuader: Absolutely! There are so many organizations around the world these days it's hard to know which one is the best. Do you know the website charitynavigator.org? It provides info on tons of organizations around the world \n\tPersuadee: No - actually we don't LOOK for places to give - they just happen with people we get involved with/ and through our church.  I'm sure it's a great website.  Is that how you got plugged in with Save the Children?\nPersuader: Oh, no, that's just one I use if someone is recommended a charity to me. I got involved with Save the Children because I was working with a local NGO in Greece and we partnered with them frequently for English classes and kid's activities and safety\n\tPersuadee: Sounds like a great way to network!

And we're not asking for a lot, just some or all of your incoming payment for your task.

Why should I donate to this one in particular?\nPersuader: You're right. A lot of organization collect funds and then it goes to administration or advertising and not a lot of money goes to the people who need it the most. Save the Children makes sure to give as much as they possibly can, because they understand that when it comes to people who are starving, every penny counts.\n\tPersuadee: Is there any concrete proof that they do? Words are just words sometimes.\nPersuader: I totally understand that!

So what are the amounts for donation accepted?\nPersuader: Thank you so much for even taking the time to consider it! I know I always feel so selfish when I'm eating lunch and I see a commercial for people who are starving, it just really gets to me and I'm so glad you care about making a difference as well! You can choose any amount between 0 and all of your payment for this task. \n\tPersuadee: Ok. I'll donate $0.50.\nPersuader: Are you sure you don't want to donate any more?

Children are the future and unfortunately too many of them don't get the quality of life that we take advantage of today. Sometimes we're in a better place and we have to do what we can to help their conditions a little bit. Even little bits can go a long way, you know?\n\tPersuadee: it does, and charities can go further with the amount of money donated.\nPersuader: Absolutely. I remember seeing ads on the television about it and it breaks my hear to see children so sad and suffering in conditions that they live in. I haven't personally witnessed experiences first hand, however, it comes down to basic human needs.\n\tPersuadee: It's sad to think being born in the wrong conditions can have such a lifelong impact.\nPersuader: Exactly. It's not like we really get the choice of how/when/where we are born. It's a matter of chance. It's unfair to be born into conditions like that.\n\tPersuadee: Hopefully, more the people born more lucky can lend a hand.\nPersuader: Absolutely!
