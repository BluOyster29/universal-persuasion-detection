We can't do much with 30 cents, but in another country that could make a big impact.  \n\tPersuadee: Sure.  I would love to help.  I would love to make a donation today.\nPersuader: That's amazing.  Should we give our whole 30 cents?  It's not like either of us can do much with that either.\n\tPersuadee: Probably more.  Do you donate by the catalog or general donation?\nPersuader: I read that the people sponsoring this research study are collecting money, and at the end we have the option of just telling them to keep our payment and give it to Save the Children instead of paying out to us.  Hassle free.  \n\tPersuadee: Ok, sounds good.  I'll donate the whole amount.\nPersuader: I'm so glad I got partnered with you.  With all the negativity in the news, I'm glad to see there are still great people out there.\n\tPersuadee: Great.  I've been looking at the Save the Children website so I will likely buy off the catalog, like Emergency Food.  Thanks for sharing.\nPersuader: Yeap, I think I need to look at the website again and see the new ways to donate.  So we'll both donate the money we earn here, then we can donate extra off the website.  I'm going to blog about you later today.  It will encourage our friends.  \n\tPersuadee: Very good.  I glad we can help.  Every bit helps. \nPersuader: Nice to meet you fellow Turker. You've encouraged my heart today.\n\tPersuadee: Ditto to you. Have a great day. God bless!\nPersuader: Goodbye.  Have a wonderful day.\n\tPersuadee: You.

Have you come to talk about the charity?\nPersuader: Yes I'm here to talk about an organization called Save The Children. It's a charity you should donate to\n\tPersuadee: Well, why exactly should I donate? There's a lot of charities out there, what makes yours special?\nPersuader: Let me ask you this, do you have children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I have one child. He's four.\nPersuader: Perfect. Now I want you to imagine how your child's life would be if he was alone, bouncing from foster home to foster home. Imagine him with no strong mentor or leader in his life. How does that make you feel?\n\tPersuadee: I would suppose that it would be a rough life, but even if I did want to donate to a children's charity specifically, why would I choose yours out of all of them?\nPersuader: You should pick my charity because we pride ourselves on transparency. If you were to give me $0.50 today I could tell you exactly where all the money was to go. You want to know where? It's going straight into a college fund for a foster child. \n\tPersuadee: If I did decide to donate to you, what would the average donation be? \nPersuader: The average donation is 25 cents to 50 cents. Anything helps\n\tPersuadee: Well, I think I would like to send a donation, but first I still want to know a little bit more. Does every single penny go towards the foster children or does the donation company keep a percentage of the profits?\nPersuader: For all of our donations from individuals, 100% of the proceeds go to the child. The charity runs from larger donations from corporations. \n\tPersuadee: That's good to hear, I'm feeling more inclined to donate now, but could you first tell me more about who runs the charity operations? or if there's any other uses that this money will go towards outside of college funds?\nPersuader: The charity has a dedicated operations team that has been running the ship for over a decade now. We do take donations for things other than college funds, including: food donations, clothing etc. I just work on the college team\n\tPersuadee: That's fair, well, I guess that it wouldn't hurt to give some money to your charity. How do I go about doing that?\nPersuader: It's pretty easy, the donation can be deducted from your task payment. \n\tPersuadee: Alright, well, once we've finished up here then I will be sure to do that.\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your donation, it really might not seem like much. But it's going to a great cause, something you can feel good about.\n\tPersuadee: No problem, it is always nice to help out a good cause.

They cannot provide for themselves and often are put in situations because of other people. I hope your situation improves.  Maybe just this once, would you be willing to donate 10 cents of your hit?  That would leave you $1.90 and a child can be blessed because of just 10 cents.\n\tPersuadee: There are three kinds of charities I would never consider donating to:  children's, diseases and veterans.\nPersuader: What type of charities do you donate to?

Poor people I see on the street.\nPersuader: That's great and very worthy causes. I know it is not easy to donate when you have no extra money. I also donate to food pantries and have passed out many sandwiches and drinks to the homeless. I even made a sleeping bag out of grocery sacks, it was waterproof so the guy gave it to could sleep off of the wet ground.

I also agree that people here have better access to gov't assistance. That being said, as a foster parent, it is my experience that children here starve, too.

I guess that makes me seem a little selfish but 10 cents will but a pack of noodles that will feed 2 kids at my house. \nPersuader: alright well if you cant donate i understand can you please state for the requesters how much you would like to donate to make if offical anywhere between 0 and 2 dollars\n\tPersuadee: Thank you, again for your service.

I have also experienced a significant loss of income, thus working on Mturk to make ends meet.\nPersuader: That's very awesome of you and I am sorry to hear of your recent loss of income. I understand needing MTurk for supplemental income as our family is single income right now and sometimes its rough living paycheck to paycheck! I think that is why this opportunity is so unique today. The donation you choose to commit (which can be as little as 1 cent) will be deducted from the payment for this HIT and automatically sent to save the children by the requestor. \n\tPersuadee: Well, I think I could probably send at least 50 cents, will you be able to match that amount?\nPersuader: The payment for this HIT is 30 cents (at least on my end) and I don't think we can exceed that amount. I will DEFINITELY match you if you are willing to donate the 30 cents from your payment :)\n\tPersuadee: oh! Ok, well then I can certainly donate the 30 cents  as well. Good way to end my night.\nPersuader: Couldn't agree more :) Thank you for your donation and I wish you the best of luck with your grandchildren and here on MTurk :) \n\tPersuadee: Same to you.

I suppose even with the economy being as hard as it is, exchange rates are still good enough to make a real impact. \nPersuader: Yes any donations made to helpless children make a real impact on their life.

I want you to think about what it means to save a child thats in trouble and how by saving that child you find new hope in your own life.\n\tPersuadee: I'm certainly willing to listen. Tell me about Bruce.\nPersuader: Bruce was born to a single mother who was only 14 at the time he came into this world , the girls mother and father were ashamed of her pregnancy and kicked out of the house. Bruce was born and taken from the girl because she was to young to raise him and her was adobted out to a poor family that did their best to provide for him . The founder of save the children heard about the family and learned of Bruces story . He came to meet Bruce .\n\tPersuadee: That poor girl, being rejected by her own family like that. I'm glad that Bruce was taken in, though. How did the visit go?\nPersuader: The owner got involved in Bruces life and sav the children went to work and provide food and cloths and school needs for Bruce . Bruce went own to join the save the children foundation after he completed college and is helping save children today. \n\tPersuadee: That's awesome! He even made it through college. I can see how he'd be really devoted to the organization, given the impact they had on his life.\nPersuader: Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.\n\tPersuadee: If only all kids were so lucky.

Are these children specifically from poor countries? Or may it included children affected by, let's say, Hurricane Katrina back in 2005?\nPersuader: There is a US Program as well as a global outlet\n\tPersuadee: That is good to hear. How specifically will these children be helped? Will the foundation only provide homes? Or is there more to it?\nPersuader: There's definitely more to it STC provides advocacy, education, protection, and food among other services\n\tPersuadee: So it seems that the STC is an all around foundation, aiming to prevent disasters from stunting the progress of young ones. Do you think the foundation is part of the first helpers to a disaster? Or is it a more gradual affect they provide? \nPersuader: The foundation is with children every step of the way from the initial stages of an event to the residual effects months/years later STC looks to help\n\tPersuadee: I do believe being there for every step of the way can really improve the child's chances for success, which is heartwarming. Since I have not heard of the foundation from the start, do you think there impact is less great, than other foundations that are known, such as Red Cross?\nPersuader: Every organization has it's own impact. STC reached 155 million children during 2017 235,000 of which were in the United States. That's a pretty big impact. You can view more stats here  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report\n\tPersuadee: That is a huge impact. I have quickly researched the foundation, and have seen some of these stats. It seems even corporations are involved with the foundation, such as the CEO of Chobani, who believes we should save every child possible. I believe that more companies, like chobani, should partner and donate some of the proceedings they receive to help the children. Do you agree? \nPersuader: Yes I do. Support from corporations would really help in communities across the world\n\tPersuadee: Refering back to the aid STC provides, do you think it is better to provide emergency assistance, just days or weeks after the disaster, or provide gradual assistance after the initial affects of the disaster has been solved? Do you think the foundation needs to pick and choose based on the funding they have?\nPersuader: STC does strive to meet needs at both times, however emphasis is placed on emergency services because it is believed that is when children are most vulnerable. With proper funding we will be able to continue assisting through out the entire process. You can help How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: That makes a lot of sense, a good basis can propagate to the next few months. I have always been reluctant in donating to such foundations, due to many corruptions in this industry. It is said that most of these foundations are Non-Profit, however, some of these foundations provide false help. I have read that Red Cross showed up at a disaster with empty trucks, just for publicity. How can I know for sure any of these foundations are legit?\nPersuader: I definitely understand Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.   In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services.   \n\tPersuadee: Reports on the financials of the company/foundation is very important, and I appreciate the search for the statistics. I do believe statistics like these can help and persuade people to donate more. I do believe that the government should make such reports mandatory, and even possibly provide a certain status to those foundations that do use a majority of their revenue for the purposes they claim. Do you think the government should involve themselves in such scandals that may occur?\nPersuader: Government involvement may be necessary in those cases. Thankfully STC doesn't have anything to worry about in that department. Would you be willing to donate today?\n\tPersuadee: I appreciate the conversation and all the statistics you have given me, however, I will not be donating to said foundation. I believe a good majority of these foundations make false claims. I would be willing to volunteer, but I will not give hard earned money to something that would go against my beliefs against corporate corruption.", "label": [[11, 62, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [191, 261, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [429, 477, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1006, 1156, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1461, 1501, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1502, 1591, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1591, 1619, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1619, 1694, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2102, 2111, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [2112, 2187, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [2522, 2682, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [2682, 2771, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [2772, 2835, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [2836, 2899, "3-EMOTION-ALTERCASTING"], [3427, 3629, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [3714, 3784, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [4427, 4464, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [635, 740, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [2772, 2836, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [3629, 3711, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [4299, 4355, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [4355, 4427, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"]], "idx": "877"}

So only 10% to administrative costs. The other thing is that we can help a child by donating the cost of a candy bar! \n\tPersuadee: How is the money distributed? Who precisely is performing the relief help?\nPersuader: Volunteers provide the relief work through a variety of programs and emergency aid. The money is distributed where it is needed most - so if there is an emergency more money will go there. But there is a question that I would like to ask you.\n\tPersuadee: Go ahead, ask.\nPersuader: Would you be willing to donate $0.20 to the relief work if I match the donation from this Mturk task?

Do one of those sound interesting to you?\n\tPersuadee: All of them sounds interesting, I mean I have a soft heart for children. are they clear with their financial reports?\nPersuader: Yes, according to give.org they receive top marks on charity accountability.\n\tPersuadee: That's awesome, do they accept volunteers? I do not have many off days but they idea would be nice\nPersuader: There are opportunities to participate in events and advocacy and an e-mail sign up to keep in tune with the organization's activities.\n\tPersuadee: that is so nice. do they have any website that I can visit?\nPersuader:  URL  The email sign up is at the bottom of the page. In addition, you can donate part of your payment today to the organization if interested.\n\tPersuadee: Thanks for the information. I would like to know if the big companies cooperate with them?\nPersuader: Interesting you ask that. There is an employee matching program where individuals who work at companies will donate some amount of money and companies pledge to match. Take a moment to peruse the website and see if you would like to donate.Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I know and I will donate\nPersuader: Great! It is a great organization in 2017 86% of every dollar raised went to helping children around the world.\n\tPersuadee: That is good, I sure will help and I will visit the website to help later. I mean if it is ethical organization I will donate monthly \nPersuader: That is good.

I make donations to charity regularly but not from jobs that I do.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a great international no-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. It has a very low overhead and almost all the money donated to it is directly used to help children.\n\tPersuadee: I know that it is a good organization and I support them.  However I am not getting a reward from this hit.  I am spending my time completing it so I am being paid for a job.  I want the money to do with as I choose.\nPersuader: Save the Children has helped build hundreds of schools in developing nations around the world. They've educated many children who have gone on to do important medical and other life saving jobs.\n\tPersuadee: I still do not want to make a donation from this money.\nPersuader: Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year! Save the Children is helping to evacuate as many children as possible from that country. Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I do think that they do.\nPersuader: Don't you want to be part of the solution by giving as much money as possible to Save the Children so they can help as many children as possible?\n\tPersuadee: I do not want to make a donation today.\nPersuader: Think about how you were probably going to just waste the measly reward amount you were being offered for this HIT on junk food or coffee and think about what amazing things Save the Children would be able to do with that money.\n\tPersuadee: I am not going to waste the reward.  I use it for things that my family needs.\nPersuader: Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money. Your family is rich enough to live in a first world country and have food on a daily basis. By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.\n\tPersuadee: We work for everything that we have.  Nothing is just given to us soooo I am not going to give away something that I work for unless I want to do so.\nPersuader: Of course you work for everything you own. By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.\n\tPersuadee: It still does not change the fact that I am not going to make a donation with this money.\nPersuader: Save the Children will even let you know about the specific child that your money is helping. So you will really get to know that one child. It's not just some faceless organization with faceless non existant children. Everything is completly real and on the up and up.\n\tPersuadee: I understand this and have supported Unbound a similar charity for years.  Since I already donate to a charity like this I am not making a donation. \nPersuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

{"id": 3176, "data": "Persuader: Hi!  How are you?  Today, I am working toward getting donations for an international organization called Save the Children.  Are you a parent?\n\tPersuadee: Hi, I'm good.  How are you?  I am not a parent. \nPersuader: I'm really good.  I have three children in high school.  I always wanted more children and I think that is why I am so passionate about Save the Children.  Do you donate to any children's charities?\n\tPersuadee: No, I have never donated to any children's charities. I usually donate to other causes.\nPersuader: Personally, I only donate to two causes.  I donate to a local Down Syndrome Organization and Save the Children.  I have found that many charities are making the organizers rich and the money doesn't always go toward causes I believe in.  Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I have only heard of Save the Children from doing HITs on mTurk.  Its a commonly referenced charity...so much so that I am convinced its not real lol\nPersuader: Lol!  I have seen it several times as well, but I assure you, it is real.  Donations to Save the Children ensure children's right to health, education and safety.  I prefer helping people in my own community, however, I feel that Save the Children is so important to children in the USA and other countries.  Today, I am only looking for a small donation.  Would you ever consider donating to an international organization?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I would consider it\nPersuader: To prove that Save the Children is real, I can provide their website if you would like to research it:   URL \n\tPersuadee: Looks good to me.  Donating would be a nice thing to do\nPersuader: Sometimes I doubt what I see on mTurk too!  I wanted to assure you the organization is real.  Did you see that half of refugees are children and 77 cents a day can provide shelter for an entire family?\n\tPersuadee: Yeah I did.  Its hard to believe that so little can do so much!\nPersuader: When I saw that, it made me feel terrible.  Just yesterday I spent twice that on a fountain drink at a gas station.  I drank half of it and threw the rest away.  Did you have an amount you were thinking of donating?\n\tPersuadee: Yeah its amazing when you think about how much we waste in our day to day lives.  A dollar seems like a good amount to donate. \nPersuader: Like I said, I am only looking for small donations today, so $1 would be fantastic!  \n\tPersuadee: Alright great.  A dollar it is!\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children\n\tPersuadee: OK, its just good to know that Save the Children is actually real\nPersuader: I agree.  I always do mTurk hits as a way to save for a family vacation.  I rarely donate when they ask because I'm never sure they are real or if it's a way for the requester to save money.  Thank you so much for your donation and it was nice chatting with you!\n\tPersuadee: Same here.  These requestors sure can be sneaky.
