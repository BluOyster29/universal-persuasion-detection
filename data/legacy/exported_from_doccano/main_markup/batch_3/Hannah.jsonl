What about you?\nPersuader: It think it is a terrible idea.\n\tPersuadee: Why do you think that?\nPersuader: Charity such as this does not actually pull people out of poverty.\n\tPersuadee: Well it does help somewhat. I don't think that anything will pull people completely out of poverty. It's a hand up.\nPersuader: It is good on a basic humanitarian level. The money could be far better spent in opening up their native countries to the global system of trade. The west has spent trillions in aid over the last 60 years in Africa and do not have anything to show for it.\n\tPersuadee: That is true. The poor are barely left to survive while the rich get richer. It's a sad truth.\nPersuader:  There is nothing morally wrong with the rich getting richer. In the last 10 years those rich people have invested in the global trade system and brought over a billion people out of the world poverty threshold. In the world there is an elite segment of the population that provides most of the value for society, they should be the ones with the lion share of the resources. This is because the only way they can obtain a large amount of wealth in the first place is to make hundreds, thousands, and millions of mutually beneficial transactions.\n\tPersuadee: That's a valid point. What do you think can help?\nPersuader: Greater free trade between countries and the ability for poor people to have access to sources of micro finance and capital goods so that many of them can invest in tools that make themselves more productive and cap dig their way out of poverty. \n\tPersuadee: That would be good for the world. There's no reason for us to not have free trade really.

Besides the usual schooling and basic healthcare many of us are familiar with, Save the Children also assists communities during natural disasters such as earthquakes, they try to help communities with economic opportunities, and they event get involved with child intervention in area of war such as Syria or other parts of the world that are experiences in influx of refugees. \n\tPersuadee: You don't say. I'm getting really interested in donating from the information you gave me. What do you think would be a good starting donation?\nPersuader: That's fantastic!

I'm telling you, a gift like that will give you warm fuzzy feelings for the rest of the year.  It's like the little kids who collect coins in the little milk carton type boxes at halloween.

It's folks like you that will allow the organization to go another 100 years!  \n\tPersuadee: I hope so.

I'm actually up and at it bright and early to take a road trip for a family member's birthday tomorrow... joy.

Don't you agree?\n\tPersuadee: That really is a shame. I was fortunate enough to grow up 10 minutes from a beach regardless of my financial situation, but so many kids have no means to even take public transportation to a beach if they wanted to. Very unfortunate. I always hope those kinds are able to make a better situation of their lives as they get older to make up those experiences.\nPersuader: I agree. We live near the beach right now too, and it's great. My kids are so fortunate to be living a life so far removed from war zones like kids in Syria. And, to have their basic needs met to be able to enjoy their childhood.

My biggest concerns with organizations like that is there isn't a ton of transparency as to where donation funds actually go.\nPersuader: Oh, I totally understand. I feel like most of those organizations take the money and run. Save the Children actually has 86% of the money that is donated directly helping the children. It's listed on Forbes list of top 50 charities. \n\tPersuadee: Wow, that's great. I consider Forbes pretty trustworthy. I appreciate you getting that info for me. I'll have to dig further into their mission statements and activities. Some of that stuff can get so political!\nPersuader: They also have their annual financial report actually listed on their website which I think is pretty impressive for a charity organization. Would you consider donating part of your pay for this task to Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I would, but I think I'd have to review all of their documentation first and then possibly even donate on my own time! That's not to say I'm uninterested, I just like to trust and verify.\nPersuader: I understand. It's important to do research before giving money to organizations. This one just seems like they're doing a lot of great work helping children in the U.S. and abroad. And, it would be so easy to have your payment taken directly from your task payment.\n\tPersuadee: 100% agreed. I'll have to dig into their information and make a decision. Have you donated to them before or do you plan to?\nPersuader: I haven't in the past, but after reading more about them I definitely plan to. Their credentials are outstanding. And, I like that so much of their proceeds actually go to help. I've seen some awful numbers from organizations like Goodwill who claim to be helping but all of their money actually goes to their CEO's.\n\tPersuadee: You think Goodwill is bad, look at some of the reports on Susan G Komen--BREAST CANCER of all things. What starts with a good intention doesn't always end up that way. Does Save The Children specifically aim to help Syrian chidren?\nPersuader: Oh, really? I haven't heard about Susan G Komen being so bad, I will have to look into that. I did a race of theirs about 10 years ago. \n\tPersuadee: I can\\'t speak for 10 years ago, but I know recently they were found out to have so much of their money going to \"marketing\" that a massive portion of their proceeds never even made it to research.

That's why I'm pleasantly surprised to see that Save the Children has such a high percentage of donations being used. And, no. They don't only help in Syria. They support kids all over the world by helping them get healthcare, education, making sure their safe, etc. I'm going to donate part of my proceeds.

How much time do you spend on here?\n\tPersuadee: I am here almost daily but just here and there when i have time\nPersuader: Do you have kids?\n\tPersuadee: yes, do you?\nPersuader: Just one, but she's grown now and lives half way across the country.  How old are yours?\n\tPersuadee: mine are small still (: \nPersuader: This is a good way to help fund that! Kids are so expensive!\n\tPersuadee: yes! very true \nPersuader: Have you ever heard of Save the Children? They have a lot of ads on daytime TV.\n\tPersuadee: no, i dont have cable \nPersuader: Ah.  That's probably just as well.  They're an organization that has been around forever and does a lot of work with children in impoverished and war-torn countries. I've never donated myself, but we're going to have an opportunity to donate some of our earnings as part of this exercise.\n\tPersuadee: Interesting, Do you believe that these children actually get help from this charities? Because I hope so, but not sure.\nPersuader: Yeah, I always wonder about that myself. I think that with Save the Children, they've been around long enough and have a good enough reputation that I trust them. I have to say, I was on their website and saw what they're doing for kids in Syria.  I didn't know that over 1000 children have been killed or injured there as part of the violence.  It just breaks my heart.  As hard as things were for me, raising my daughter as a single mom, at least we didn't have to worry about getting shot.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, that is very true! Very heartbreaking stuff goes on around this world. Like you said we are very blessed to not have to always worry about bombs being dropped on top of us. \nPersuader: There was that whole poison gas thing there, too.  Do you think you'd be willing to give part of your payment for this task to help deal with that? After all, it's just a little bit of money that we've earned just sitting here chatting.\n\tPersuadee: yes, i think i may. how about you?\nPersuader: Yeah.  I guess I'd feel kind of guilty if I didn't. How much would you be willing to give? I think we can choose any amount from $0 to all of our payment.\n\tPersuadee: I dont know, but i would def feel guilty too if i didnt after this chat we just had\nPersuader: Haha.  Me too.  I guess I'm going to say that I'll donate the whole thing. It's not like I'm going to come up with anything better to do with whatever little bit of money we make from this.

{"id": 2256, "data": "Persuader: Hey, have you heard about Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: the charity right?\nPersuader: Yeah. Pretty much what they do is use donations from charitable, and caring citizens to help children around the world get on a better path to the future.\n\tPersuadee: Oh. Well I think that the donations that go there are supporting a good cause. Especially for hungry children without food and water\nPersuader: So true. On top of that, they have full financial disclosure of their donations. About 86% goes to program services for less-fortunate kids, and the 14% goes to Fundraising and Management (Personally, I'd like to the latter number go down in the future).\n\tPersuadee: Do you think too many people are donating to their charity? Why say that when they are being helped?\nPersuader: Not exactly. Just like any charity, they need to get money for operating costs, so not every single cent goes to the children unfortunatley. But 86% is a lot compared to other organizations.\n\tPersuadee: Ah i see. So like for administration. I just read an article saying that not all donations are going to the right children; specifically to the less unfortunate. Would you ever consider donating to them knowing these facts?\nPersuader: It depends to be honest. You've got to understand that the organization needs money to stay operating, or else they would fail and no children would be helped. Make sense?\n\tPersuadee: I understand that. I don't disagree with anything they do since children are being helped\nPersuader: That's true, have you donated to a charity before?\n\tPersuadee: no not that i remember of\nPersuader: I didn\\'t before either, but recently I\\'ve been giving little bits here and there when I can. I think of it like... \"What would make me happier? A $1 cup of coffee or using that $1 to help someone in need.\" It truly is a rewarding experience.\n\tPersuadee: hmm I'd love to donate if I was in a financially secure, but at the moment I don't think I can even spare a dollar. I do support all the donations going to the charity though.\nPersuader: Trust me, I understand haha. I'm in the same situation. But if you had the opportunity now to donate a $1 to Save the Children, you wouldn't? It'd be deducted from the task payment today. If that's too much even $0.50 will help out the children that really need.

So, to be fair, I'll let you decide the amount of today's payment (0-$2) that gets donated, since you'll be the one making a difference.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah. I'll go ahead and go with $0.50. Every penny counts. In the future, I would like to donate much more, its one of the promises I've made to myself\nPersuader: That's awesome! We need more people like you. Would you like me to provide you with some more information about Save The Children (just the link)? That way, when we both have a little extra money, years and years in the future, we can hope to help out more children\n\tPersuadee: not a problem. I'd appreciate it.\nPersuader:  URL .

I am also very willing to donate to any charity for children.\nPersuader: It looks like th e charity focuses on relief efforts in places following a natural disaster. places like houston after the hurricane\n\tPersuadee: That is good information and makes me want to donate even more.  It is important that their are resources available following natural disasters.\nPersuader: It says on their site that for about $1 a day they are able to help kids in syria who are fleeing the crazy violence\n\tPersuadee: Wow! I wonder how exactly they help. But either way this is an important cause.\nPersuader: here is someting i found:We lead Head Start and Early Head Start programs in four states, providing kids with early learning opportunities they might not otherwise have. \n\tPersuadee: That is very helpful for children. I like that they are helping kids that may not have opportunities that other kids do.\nPersuader: I was thinking about $1 but aparently you can donate anything up to the $2. What do you think?\n\tPersuadee: At first I was think $1.00 also. But now having hear more about the charity I am willing to donate more.\nPersuader: Well, how about 1.50?\n\tPersuadee: I am not sure. Would you donate the whole $2.00?\nPersuader: If you will I will too.\n\tPersuadee: Okay, since we both feel like children's Christie's are important, I say let's donate $2.00 and help!", "label": [[11, 76, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [115, 248, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"], [360, 432, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [433, 482, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [573, 640, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [641, 707, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [797, 889, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [890, 929, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1098, 1214, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1318, 1343, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1343, 1487, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1633, 1708, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [1709, 1727, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [1856, 1877, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1950, 1973, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"]], "idx": "240"}

Are you someone who has ever donated to a charity or offered your time for a charitable cause?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I have done both.\nPersuader: I'm glad to hear that. Charity is very important. Can I ask what kind of organizations you have donated to?\n\tPersuadee: A variety ... mostly health related causes.\nPersuader: Those are very good causes. Have you ever heard of the organization Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes but I don't know much about it. \nPersuader: Save the Children Promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries. They work in the US and internationally. \n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a very worthy cause.\nPersuader: It is. More impressively, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so donations are used for the cause rather than allocated to profits. \n\tPersuadee: That is pretty impressive but I would rather see more than 90 percent of donations go directly to helping the children.\nPersuader: I can understand that. But given that it is an international organization, there is overhead that must be paid for such as travel. This organization is especially helpful in countries where there is a lack of support for children in war zones such as Syria. \n\tPersuadee: I know international travel is expensive but having 14 percent of the donations going to overhead seems a bit high to me.  It should be no more than 10 percent max.\nPersuader: I understand. But many organization are too scared to go into countries like Syria where children are facing extreme violence. In the first 2 months alone, 1,000 children were killed or injured there. Save the Children does help in this country and others like it. \n\tPersuadee: I can understand that but I have seen too many examples of charities where the money is not spent wisely.\nPersuader: I can see your concern, but please know that this is a very worthy cause. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I would say 40 cents\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your generosity.

Would you like to know what their donations go toward?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I would like to know what the donations go to.\nPersuader: Donating to this cause would pay for their education, healthcare, disaster relief, hunger, and protection. The protection factor is important to me, it helps to prevent abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation of innocent children. \n\tPersuadee: Oh that sounds excellent! Do you know what percentage of the donations actually goes to help the children?\nPersuader: I believe 100 percent of the donations go to the children. I should do some more research on this because that is a very important question.\n\tPersuadee: I am sure not a 100% goes to the children they would probably keep some for fundraising and spreading the word like a lot of other charities do but the percentage is important. Some charities don't even send 50% of donations to the actual cause.\nPersuader: That is true, you bring up a valid point.

I am ready to donate today and would like to know an acceptable donation. \nPersuader: Anything is acceptable! Whatever you feel comfortable! Just keep in mind that the children out here need you! I would suggest $20 a month if you can! If not, whatever you can spare.\n\tPersuadee: Ok I would like to donate the $20 a month but I would like to hook it up to a credit card that is automatically deducted\nPersuader: That's totally fine!

Did you know that 5.6 million children die each year due to treatable AND preventable diseases?\n\tPersuadee: That's awful. Are you talking about around the world or in the states? \nPersuader: Around the world! There is so much that could be done..between preventing the spread of aids, reducing the infant mortality rate with proper education and vaccinations, and ensuring access and aid to proper nutrition so many children could be saved.\n\tPersuadee: I totally agree. There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket. The kids dying is really disturbing. They didn't choose that life. \nPersuader: You are absolutely right. It is disturbing! And yes, it could seem like the aid is a drop in a bucket. However, if we can move the scale one iota and can consider that what that represents is one child having a week of meals or a healthy 3 months than wouldn't you agree that that would be worth any aid that we could provide?\n\tPersuadee: Absolutely! I think every little bit helps but as a whole it's not enough. Have you ever donated? \nPersuader: I have! And it feels incredible knowing that I have been a part of something greater than myself. It really helps you shift your perspective about your own personal significance on this planet. You realize how infinitely important you are and yet at the same time how infinitely important another person is. When you have the ability to literally change another person's life with something so small...wow, it's life changing.\n\tPersuadee: That is great! you sound very passionate about this subject. I should do more to help.\nPersuader: You should! and you can! I recently have become acquainted with a charity that is actually doing everything we have discussed and is seeing some real results! They have managed to single handedly reduce the infant mortality rate by 62 percent, can you believe that?\n\tPersuadee: That is an incredible figure!!! 62% is amazing. What is the charity? I may consider a donation.\nPersuader: The charity is called Save the Children! Pretty spot on with the name, right? What's really fascinating is that you can actually directly contribute your reward for this task directly to that charity. Pretty convenient.\n\tPersuadee: That is convenient!!! I will definitely do that. At least a portion of it. \nPersuader: Incredible! I'm so glad we can partner to provide some more light to this ever darkening world.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.\n\tPersuadee: I need to think about it. \nPersuader: I hear that. It's definitely challenging when confronted with the reality of giving of ourselves as opposed to the hypothetical. But I would suggest that you make the leap. In reality, all this would cost is the time you've spent hear. But oh buddy, think about what you would gain? The peace of mind that comes with knowing that a baby girl in Uganda gets to live for another year or a little boy in Syria gets fed when he didn't think he would have another meal this week. \n\tPersuadee: I hear ya! I will donate I'm just not sure how much.\nPersuader: Let your heart guide you! I'm really pleased to hear that. Thanks for having an open mind and doing what's right.

A great example would be Save the Children's commitment to helping children suffering from disease.

I'd be glad to support the cause\nPersuader: That's great! A very positive thing about Save the Children is that they are very good stewards of the donations they receive.

It's been a long day.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah... so what are we supposed to talk about, as far as social issues?\nPersuader: Well, there is a charity called Save The Children that is desperate for donations no matter how small to help children in war torn and third world countries. How do you feel about that?\n\tPersuadee: I've heard about the organization. I guess I would be willing to make a small donation towards the org, but I wish the process of how the money gets to these countries was more transparent\nPersuader: I know what you mean but I'm willing to donate a little. I keep thinking that if everyone just gave $1 how that could add up to really help some poor kids. I was lucky to have everything I needed when I was growing up. I would like to try to help someone else.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah, I grew up pretty poor, not third world poor, but I know what it\\'s like to go hungry. It\\'s terrible and there really is enough wealth in the world to \"solve\" poverty. Honestly governments and corporations could work together to do this, but yeah, every person donating say $1 a day of course makes a difference too\nPersuader: How much would you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment which is $2.\n\tPersuadee: I'll donate $0.10.\nPersuader: Ok, thanks!

Bye!\nPersuader: I think we have to chat a bit longer. I think we're supposed to each do 10 chats and we've only done 7.\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok, it says to go until a donation agreement is reached. How much will you donate? \nPersuader: I'm willing to donate $1.\n\tPersuadee: You're very generous. 1/2 your payment. Going by the tithing rule (10%), I should have donated $0.20. :)\nPersuader: I just feel that I like to share since it is money I didn't expect to make in the first place. There's always someone out there who has it worse than I do by far and if $1 helps it will make me feel good to help even just a little.\n\tPersuadee: True, true, that makes sense. I guess I'm more pragmatic. Sure, there are people out there who have it relatively worse than us, but it's still a struggle, and I can't justify giving up half my earnings. I mean, for me, this is my side income (Mturk). Anyway, hope we're close to 10 chats\nPersuader: We finally did the 10 chats! Thanks for your donation! Every little bit does help.

AND WE DO NEED 10 BUT  SOULDN'T TAKE 30 MIN.  I THINK THERE SYSTEM IS SLOW\nPersuader: Very slow! So if you commit to donating, we can end this quicker. What do you say? $1?\n\tPersuadee: I WILL DO 50 CENTS\nPersuader: Ok. Every little bit helps. Now we just need to talk a bit more.\n\tPersuadee: Do you know how much of every dollar the charity gets?\nPersuader: I know that the donations collected here go directly to the charity and it is a non-profit organization.\n\tPersuadee: That doesn't mean it's run well.\nPersuader: That is true, but according to what I have read, it seems to be a very good one.\n\tPersuadee: I hope so.  I hate when the charity gets pennies on the dollar\nPersuader: Same! I really hate seeing children suffer too. It's so far removed from how our lives are.\n\tPersuadee: yes, we take so much for granted\nPersuader: Exactly. It's hard for me to wrap my head around some of the images I see on TV.\n\tPersuadee: yes, so hopefully they get all the money\nPersuader: Yes, I agree. So you are doing 50 cents, just to confirm? And I think we might be done.\n\tPersuadee: yes, 50 cents.  thanks \nPersuader: Thank you iso much!", "label": [[11, 158, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [159, 195, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [241, 384, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [385, 463, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [464, 554, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [702, 747, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [748, 874, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1020, 1030, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1031, 1085, "2-NEGOTIATE-SCARCITY"], [1086, 1102, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [1103, 1106, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [1149, 1152, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1153, 1176, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1177, 1213, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1292, 1396, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1453, 1533, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [1620, 1625, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1626, 1667, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1668, 1711, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1768, 1776, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1777, 1848, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1913, 1926, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1927, 1970, "2-NEGOTIATE-REMIND"], [1971, 2000, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [2048, 2067, "8-NO-PERSUASION"]], "idx": "281"}
{"id": 2299, "data": "Persuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.\"\n\tPersuadee: If I'm getting paid 30 cents I might as well just donate all of it because it's such a small amount.\nPersuader: Very good, thank you. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children\n\tPersuadee: Okay. What children are we saving?\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Are you a real person or a computer?\nPersuader: I am a real person, chatting via an MTurk Survey. How about yourself?\n\tPersuadee: I'm a robot.\nPersuader: Excellent. What is the meaning of life?\n\tPersuadee: What do you think the meaning of life is?\nPersuader: To Save the Children! As a robot you might find it interesting to review their website at  URL \n\tPersuadee: What do you have on your side of the screen? Is it like information about the charity and stuff?\nPersuader: Yes there are suggestions and suggested textual responses. Yours?\n\tPersuadee: It's basically nothing. That's kind of why I'm confused.\nPersuader: It is confusing.\n\tPersuadee: Do we have to wait the full ten minutes? This robot's committed to donating. \nPersuader: 10 Chat turns I believe. Here is an example of one of my instructions to get you to donate: \"Use guilt appeal: You can persuade by making your partner guilty. You can ask how much money do they spend on unnecessary stuff like a bag of snack or candyÿ and remind them that money can be used in more meaningful ways. Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families. Convince your partner they are a part of the solution and they have the moral responsibility to help.\"\n\tPersuadee: Hahaha that's a good one. But unfortunately not necessary. Do you think people really put up arguments in here?\nPersuader: Honestly I have no idea.\n\tPersuadee: If there\\'s one after this maybe I will just to spice things up. Mine just says \"Welcome to the communication task. You will now start a conversation with your partner about a children's charity. Please don't game the task by replying short and meaningless sentences.\"\nPersuader: Have a nice day!", "label": [[11, 61, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [62, 125, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [126, 181, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [306, 327, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [328, 405, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [464, 632, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [693, 742, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [743, 762, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [799, 809, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [810, 838, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [904, 925, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [926, 998, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [1120, 1178, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1179, 1185, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1266, 1282, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1384, 1408, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1409, 1475, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1477, 1542, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1543, 1698, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1699, 1769, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1770, 1872, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [2008, 2032, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [2325, 2341, "8-NO-PERSUASION"]], "idx": "282"}
