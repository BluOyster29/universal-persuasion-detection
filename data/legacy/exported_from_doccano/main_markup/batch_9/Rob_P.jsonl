This is fun.\n\tPersuadee: What is your role and why do you think it's fun?\nPersuader: It's my first time doing this type of assignment here.\n\tPersuadee: I've never done anything like this either.\nPersuader: Tell me, do you usually get involved with organizations that you trust and try to make a difference in the world by cooperating with the service these organizations offer?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I do a pretty good amount of volunteer work. I mostly offer my time and services as opposed to money.\nPersuader: Oh, just like me!\n\tPersuadee: What types of organizations are you involved in?\nPersuader: Mostly the ones that help children. I think offering time instead of money is the best thing to do. Giving money sounds like the easiest way to go and it doesn't require too much dedication or involvement. But when the organization is located far from where I live, I donate money. How about you? \n\tPersuadee: I don't like to donate money unless I know exactly where the money is going. I don't want to pay for administrative bonuses and vacations or things like that. \nPersuader: Have you heard of Save the Children? They are a trustful organization, they publish all the financial information on their website for all to see, and they make sure that the donations are used in the most cost-effective ways possible. Would you be willing to donate to this organization your compensation on this task?\n\tPersuadee: That is a charitable organization I have heard a lot about. The compensation for this is only $2.00 and, I guess, I can afford to donate that. I can only hope that even this small amount of money will DIRECTLY help children and no line some the pocket of some unscrupulous person.\nPersuader: I took a look in their annual report and I like what I see. I am convinced they make sure the money goes directly to the kids needs. And they have been helping 157 million children in 120 countries --not a small task. And I am sure they can appreciate even $2.00, for any penny can make a difference. I am willing to donate too. So, do you agree to donate? \n\tPersuadee: Yes, I will give my $2.00 payment to Save The Children and take the gamble that it helps someone.\nPersuader: That's the first time I hear from them, but just by looking their website I can tell they are trustworthy. Have you seen the website?  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report \n\tPersuadee: No, I wouldn't do that type of research on line because, again, it's hard to know what to trust. It could be a fake website or it could be a real website with fax statistics. That is why I usually prefer to give money directly to the cause of my choice.\nPersuader: I am happy to see that they help children all over the world, being 12% of the donations directed to children in the US.\n\tPersuadee: I hope all that information is true.\nPersuader: It was a pleasure talking to you.

There's people that don't donate just because they have no idea just how little it takes and where their money goes.\nPersuader: Exactly! Most people spend countless amounts of money on wasted product or food when something as small as $1.00 can benefit one of these children.

I think that it's hideous that these innocent people are being killed over most of the time generally hasnothing to do with them. \nPersuader: I completely agree. Save the Children is also known for providing children who live in hazardous conditions such as war zones with more security and safety. If more people in this world felt like you and I, I believe all children would have a better chance at life, don't you?\n\tPersuadee: Absolutely!

Do you have any children yourself, or do you plan to in the future?\n\tPersuadee: I do not have children of my own and am not able to have them. I am contemplating adoption for the future.\nPersuader: Oh, that's wonderful! So many kids out there need a home, after all! There are so many issues today with children, all over the world! For instance, did you know that in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1k children were killed or injured in intensifying violence?\n\tPersuadee: Wow, that is a staggering amount. I did not know that. I am a big fan of organizations who take care of the needs of hurt children.\nPersuader: Oh? That\\'s awesome!

Did you know they've won over 7 different awards for their charitable work? As a former foster kid, it makes me happy to see this place bring such awareness to the issues and needs of our young. \n\tPersuadee: I am not surprised to hear that at all. Children should not have to do through so much tragedy and devastation at such young ages. It is great that others are looking out for them.\nPersuader: Absolutely! In fact, you can even help! If you want to make a small donation from your task payment, I'm sure it would be greatly appreciated! You can donate just a few cents, or even the whole amount of your final payout if you choose!\n\tPersuadee: I probably will do that. If everyone did something, it helps the bigger overall picture and they are so worth it.\nPersuader: Absolutely! I mean, we already spend money on small snacks or a coffee we could forgo, why not give it to a charitable cause? How noble of you!\n\tPersuadee: I just know that if I were a child in need, I would be grateful for all the help I could get.\nPersuader: Absolutely! I remember being in a group home as a kid, and a bunch of ladies had made blankets and hats for us. I still have the blanket I was made to this day! A little goes a long way :)\n\tPersuadee: Wow, that is so good to hear. I'm sure it is not easy for organizations to get charitable work done but I am grateful they try and that others get involved. Kuddos to them!\nPersuader: Yeah, it really is humbling to watch society ban together and help each other! Either way, I'm sure Save the Children will appreciate your donation, and be able to save many more children in the future.

My name is Kim and I work for a charity organization.\n\tPersuadee: What type of charity organization do you work for?\nPersuader: Our charity organization is called Save the Children.

Together, we're changing children's lives and the future we all share.\n\tPersuadee: Well, that definitely sounds like a worthwhile cause. Can I ask what percentage of donations received go to helping children versus the percentage that goes to the administration of the charity?\nPersuader: Save the Children has a proven track record of using donations efficiently and effectively. Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.  In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services, 9% went to fundraising and 5% went to management and general. \n\tPersuadee: That's incredibly impressive, much better than other charities I've looked into. It must be very rewarding to be able to impact the lives of so many people.\nPersuader: Yes, In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Every donation will indeed be a help a lot of children and their families. We target the major causes of maternal, newborn and child deaths and provide the best health and nutrition programs to save children's lives and ensure they grow up healthy.\n\tPersuadee: Does the charity offer the ability to sponsor an individual child and be kept up to date on their progress?\nPersuader: Yes you can! Through child sponsorship, you can be the hero in the life of a child in need. You can make sure they grow up healthy, educated and safe. Through the power of Sponsorship, you help ensure a child in need has the best chance for success _ with a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Our innovative Sponsorship programs address the unique needs of children where they live\n\tPersuadee: That's something I would definitely like to learn more about.

I know I have heard of it, but I don't know exactly what they do or how they operate.\nPersuader: They are an organization dedicated to saving children's lives. They are mainly concerned with working in developing countries as those countries cannot do much for their sick children. \n\tPersuadee: So the organization is focused on medical issues, mainly?\nPersuader: Well, mainly sick or hungry children, although they do try to provide children with and education and shelter also.\n\tPersuadee: Oh wow! I like that they are not focused on only one aspect. When children are in need, it is seldom just one thing that they need. Hunger, poverty, lack of education... these things are all intertwined.\nPersuader: Exactly! The organization tries to make the children's lives better as a whole. However, this of course does cost money. Have you ever donated money to a charity?\n\tPersuadee: Not money, no, but  volunteer work. I used to work with an organization called Food not Bombs that helps feed the homeless, especially those homeless people who are often overlooked by or excluded by food banks and shelters.\nPersuader: That is incredible! I am always glad to hear people donate their time because it is sometimes worth more than money.\n\tPersuadee: Thanks! I have always had little money but I always have free time. VOlunteering suits me well.\nPersuader: That's wonderful. However, while I have your time, would you like to donate just $2 today to help better children's lives through Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: HOnestly, I need the cash. My entire paycheck this week went to bills, and I am wondering how I am going to afford groceries.\nPersuader: I understand! But, the small donation of $2 can go towards feeding a child for up to a week with our program. You can simply donate the $2 out of your payment for this task.\n\tPersuadee: I understand, but that payment is going to be used to feed MY children. Sorry.\nPersuader: No need for hostility! The way I see it, children are children, you are only being selfish. \n\tPersuadee: Oh no I am sorry. I didn't intend that to be hostile at all! The internet is very bad at conveying mood and such. \nPersuader: No problem, well I hope YOUR children enjoy feasting while less fortunate children scrap to eat bread crumbs.\n\tPersuadee: Wow. OKay. YOu don't really know anything about my children or my financial situation. \nPersuader: You can always donate as little as $.50. This amount could feed a kid for a day or buy a single apple for you.\n\tPersuadee: No, I will use those two dollars to provide a feast for my children.\nPersuader: Okay sir!

Do you know anything about the charity Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I think I've heard about it.\nPersuader: Well it's a great charity that puts a lot of time and effort into taking care of children's health, education and safety.\n\tPersuadee: Is it international? Is it tax deductible?\nPersuader: It is tax deductible, and it is currently in 120 countries which is very impressive for an organization that has taken on so many different initiatives.\n\tPersuadee: What kinds of things do they do? Is it like adopt a child type thing? \nPersuader: They do everything from build schools (including the hiring/training of teachers), to building hospitals and funding supplies/programs for them, to programs that aid in getting food/clothing to children in countries where they have no access to such things - and recently they've even pushed into childhood cancer and funding medication and research in lesser-developed countries.\n\tPersuadee: Wow. That is impressive. Do you work for them?\nPersuader: I don't, I'm just here to see if you'd consider donating any amount to the organization today. The funds go towards sponsoring a child or service and I think it would be a great way to give back to the world. \n\tPersuadee: It does seem worthwhile. How much of my money goes to the charity though? I don't want it all going to administrative costs and paying some CEO.\nPersuader: Oh, I totally agree with you on that. I feel the same exact way. The breakdown for Save the Children for the year 2017 was 86% went to programming, 9% fundraising and 5% went to management and general.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds good. Glad to hear it. I wouldn't mind giving something. Can I choose what program it goes to?\nPersuader: Unfortunately they don't have that flexibility for me to be able to do that - but what amount are you thinking of donating?\n\tPersuadee: I wouldn't mind donating my $2. I'd like the chance to help something worthwhile.\nPersuader: That's awesome, I wish there were more people with that attitude! I feel like the world would be in a better place!\n\tPersuadee: One person at a time! If I tell someone and you tell someone, that's two more!\nPersuader: That's a great way to think about it! I'm a big believer in passing it along as well, a little can go a long way!\n\tPersuadee: Yep.

{"id": 2663, "data": "Persuader: Hello there, how are you doing today?\n\tPersuadee: Hello, great and you?\nPersuader: Very good. I've been hearing about this charity called Save the Children, and I'm consistently amazed at what wonderful work they do.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah? well, tell me more about the charity\nPersuader: Save the children is a Non-governmental organization, meaning it's independent. It promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: What kind of countries? and What types of actions you make for the childrens?\nPersuader: Developing countries are places where the government isn't as strong, and many people live in poverty, so lots of things go unchecked that would be taken care of in more developed countries. It's important to have an independent organization look out for kids in those countries. Children are routinely treated in ways that are very bad in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: that sounds terrible, and how you help them been in other country?\nPersuader: We give them medical checkups. Many children in those countries have no routine access to healthcare, so they suffer from diseases like vitamin deficiency. We also help shine the light on abuse to help get them out of abusive situations.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds very good, I've a friend that is from a foreign country and they're in a bad situation in that place, so I think it's very important to help them in anyway we can\nPersuader: Yes. Recently Save the Children helped rescue a child who was dying from hunger in one such country. They also helped relocate many children who were orphaned by Syrian Civil War. Many tragic things happen but Save the Children helps children when no one else seems to care or be capable.\n\tPersuadee: Save the Children sounds amazing, so, please let me know, it's there anyway one can contribute or participate for the cause?\nPersuader: Yes, you can. I donated as much as I possibly could and Save the Children told me that I helped save the lives of several children by giving them food and medical care. It really warmed my heart! I'd donate everything I had to them if I could.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds amazing, and they've some webpage or some kind of way that you can see all the process that they made to help the children? I really want to know about the project in general\nPersuader: Yes, their website is  URL  Read through it and be sure to donate the maximum amount! The more kids saved the better!\n\tPersuadee: Alright! Sure would do, thank you so much for all the information, you're a great person!\nPersuader: Your welcome! Also I think you'll like to hear that Save the Children was named as one of the ten most accountable charities in a recent study. They don't waste much on overhead. The head of the charity drives a 15 year old car!\n\tPersuadee: Well, that says a lot about the people behind the charity! The webpage looks very good and legit too\nPersuader: Yes, it's pretty legit. I'd say it's one of the most legit charities out there. They regularly make sure that the whole organization is audited. You can see where all the money goes in their reports. A lot of time and effort is spent in the third world countries and so every dollar you spend goes a long way.\n\tPersuadee: That's exactly what I want to hear! that's it's my major concern with charities in general, to be honest, so tell me, it's something I can donated here right now?\nPersuader: Yes, you can donate the maximum amount immediately.\n\tPersuadee: Sorry, but right now I can't, let me organized my money and then I would go to the page\nPersuader: Okay, when you get it all together you can donate your task payment between $0 and $2.", "label": [[105, 227, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [765, 853, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [854, 935, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1026, 1057, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1057, 1181, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1182, 1263, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1467, 1562, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [1563, 1641, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [1642, 1750, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1913, 2067, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [2068, 2095, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [2439, 2470, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2381, 2438, "7-PRESSURE-FORCE"], [2598, 2727, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [2937, 2960, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [294, 472, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [574, 764, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1913, 2067, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2095, 2142, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2763, 2812, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [2961, 3016, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [3017, 3081, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [3137, 3246, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [3433, 3484, "3-EMOTION-ALTERCASTING"], [3596, 3682, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"]], "idx": "484"}

Can you tell me more?\nPersuader: Save the Children is a charitable organization that promotes children's rights. They also provide relief for children in regions subject to violence and civil unrest, and aid for needy children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: How did you learn about them?\nPersuader: I originally found out about them when someone talked to me about donating to them. Most of what I know about them comes from reading about them online.\n\tPersuadee: What countries do they help in?\nPersuader: They help children in 120 different countries, including the USA and most African, South American, and Asian countries.\n\tPersuadee: Are donations made securely and safely?\nPersuader: They are. Save the Children is a very highly rated charity, rated 88.3 out of 100 by Charity Navigator in 2016. They also disclose all of their financial information online, to promote transparency in how they spend the money donated to them.\n\tPersuadee: How much of the donation goes to the child?\nPersuader: 86% of donations go into programs to help children. Administrative costs are only about 5% of donations, with the remainder going towards fundraising efforts.\n\tPersuadee: Is that a good amount? How much can I donate?\nPersuader: 5% is a rather low administrative cost for a charity, which is good. And the portion that goes to fundraising generates more donations than the money put into it, so it overall increases the money that gets to those who need it. And any donation helps, even something as low as one or two dollars.\n\tPersuadee: What can one to two dollars buy for a child in need?\nPersuader: It depends of course on the region where the child being helped is located. But in some of the poorer parts of the world, a dollar can buy a few days worth of healthy food, or buy an item of clothing for a child who needs it.\n\tPersuadee: Can I donate one dollar?\nPersuader: Yes, a 1 dollar donation is perfectly acceptable, and greatly appreciated.\n\tPersuadee: I want to donate one dollar.\nPersuader: Excelent!

Would you be willing to donate to Save the Children now?  Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.  You can choose any amount up to $2.\n\tPersuadee: Yes definitely. I'll donate $1 from my task payment.\nPersuader: That is awesome!

I hoped you'd say that because people who care where the money goes will love helping children with Save The Children\n\tPersuadee: Do you know any more about the charity? What exactly do they do?\nPersuader: For starters,  they are an international organization (non-governmental) that promotes children's rights\n\tPersuadee: What kinds of things do they do to promote children's rights? Where does the money go when it is sent to that charity?\nPersuader: Here's the good part: the turk researchers collectthe money from the hits and sendit directly t_ the charity.  Ther problem is,  so many kids are in war zones,  food deserts,  and other tough areas.  Save The Children is there t_ defend them\n\tPersuadee: I get that, and I think it's great, but I am just very careful who I donate to. So how do they defend them? \nPersuader: One thing they do is build shelters sothey havea place to live.   That alone is a near miracle for so many of these kids.  Hey,  check this site out  URL \n\tPersuadee: Do you know if they provide a way for the next generation of these children to get out of poverty and the poverty mindset? Like instead of giving someone a fish for dinner, teach them how to fish sort of thing?\nPersuader: Gh ets the first step for a charity likethis.  When kids are fed and sheltered theyare healthy.  That lets them learn.  So,  Save The Children had literacy and learning programs they use with the kids\n\tPersuadee: That's great. It sounds similar to an organization I've been donating to for over a decade. Have you ever heard of Compassion International?\nPersuader: Yes!  I considered a child through them for several years.  I used to send him Christmas presents and such aloooong with monthly donations.   The two charities are very similar\n\tPersuadee: That's wonderful. I actually sponsor three children through them now. Two years ago I was able to go and visit one of the girls I sponsor in Peru. It was the most surreal experience and made it so much more real seeing how my money had helped her life. I also got to see firsthand what the organization does with the children. \nPersuader: That is awesome!  Experiences like that are great for the giver and the kids.   It's sad t_ see what they have to deal with even after help, many times.  You've seen this first hand so you probably wouldn't have any problem with giving STC 0.50 from the hit payment,  right?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, I can give 0.50 to the save the children organization.\nPersuader: That's very niceof you!  I appreciate that.   It's a cliche but it's true,  0.50 doesn't mean much to us but it really does matter for these kids. \n\tPersuadee: I agree with that. It goes a long way in another country. \nPersuader: Yes!  I know you already sponsor,  but would you look at the STC website and consider donating to them in ther future?  It seems like everyone wantsto helpbut thre is a lot more need than funds\n\tPersuadee: I will agree to look at it, sure. \nPersuader: Thank you so much.  I hope that youget to see all of your donations meet needs no matter who theyare to.  Thank you for the donations you've made ti sponsor ids already.
