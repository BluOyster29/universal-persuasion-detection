The lack of child support in developing countries, such as in Syria, has been growing for years now.\n\tPersuadee: Does this organization help people in the USA?\nPersuader: No, they assist children in war zones. In Syria, in 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reported to be killed of injured due to rising violence.\n\tPersuadee: How much of the proceeds go directly towards the children?\nPersuader: For every dollar donated, they receive 77 cents. It's a higher rate than most charities, because while we want most of the money to go to the children, there also needs to be some paid employees, although most are volunteers. Would you be interested in saving a child's life today?\n\tPersuadee: No, thank you.\nPersuader: Are you sure? How many dollars do you spend everyday on pointless or unnecessary items, such as a candy bar or fast food?\n\tPersuadee: I'm sure. I work hard for money so I spend it the way I want.\nPersuader: These children have no way of earning money, as their countries are in shambles. Many die of hunger or preventable disease, up 5.6 million per year. Even 50 cents makes all the difference.\n\tPersuadee: I'm not interested in this charity.\nPersuader: Are you from the US?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I am\nPersuader: Are you aware of the US bombing civilian cities in developing countries? Killing innocent children for no reason at all? \n\tPersuadee: Yes I am but I am not interested in this charity.\nPersuader: It also helps children in Europe. France, Germany, Sweden. The refugee crisis has caused many children in such countries to be without basic necessities. Even the children who were originally from Europe.\n\tPersuadee: It's a terrible situation however I only donate to American charities.

Have you heard of them?\n\tPersuadee: I think I have\nPersuader: They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: that is very good to know\nPersuader: Yes. Just recently, not sure if you've heard of it, they are working on reuniting children who were separated from their parents at the Mexico-US border.\n\tPersuadee: Thats such a noble thing they are doing\nPersuader: They are very noble.

I really need the money...\nPersuader: That is okay I understand times are tough, but they could be tougher.

I have a degree, just fell on a tough part in life. You can do that if you want, but I am keeping my full payment.

Can you tell me more please?\nPersuader: They help out in 192 countries and counting.  Their main mission is to ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.  There has been a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.\n\tPersuadee: That is awful. Do you have any information on how much of the their funds go to the actual charity part versus the administration, staff, etc?\nPersuader: Yes, about 9 out of 10 dollars go straight to the children while the other dollar would go to making sure that they can expand their capabilities and continue to help\n\tPersuadee: That is a very good ratio. Not many charities that are famous to us do that.\nPersuader: It is a very good ration and I love that they are transparent about it.  No pressure here but do you change your mind on donating?  Even if it is a small donation every penny will help these people in need\n\tPersuadee: I will donate 25 cents. I wish I could do more.\nPersuader: It is okay, you rock!

I've only just started in the last few days and I love it.  It's pretty easy money most of the time.  I'm Tommy, by the way.\n\tPersuadee: Hi Tommy I'm Cassidy. I've been using mTurk on and off for about half a year but the past month I've really commmited to doing tasks everyday. It's great to earn extra money here and there. I'm glad you're enjoying it. \nPersuader: Well thanks, Cassidy.  It definitely seems like a fun way to make some extra money.  I feel like sometimes people don't understand how even just a few dollars can make a difference in people's lives.  For example, I like to give a little money to charity each month.  And you'd be surprised how far even just a little bit of money goes in some impoverished countries.  How about you, Cassidy?  Do you like giving to charities? \n\tPersuadee: I do enjoy donating to charities. I don't usually have a ton of extra money so it's not an every month kind of thing for me but I try to give at least once a year. And when I can't give monetarily donate food, my time, and go to blood drives on my university\nPersuader: Aww, that's really considerate of you. I have two sponsored kids myself, one from Ghana and one from Mexico and they send me letters every month.  Cassidy, you'd be surprised how emotionally attached I am to them and I have never even met them.  I send them 20 dollars on their birthdays and then they send me pics of what they bought.  It's really sweet.  Then there is another charity I like a lot which allows for really small donations.  Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: No, I haven't heard of Save the Children. And its awesome that you help out those kids in need\nPersuader: The thing is, Cassidy, is that I don't have any of my own right now, so it kind of fills a need, you know? I like Save the Children because they rank towards the top of reputable charities on the ranking sites. The other thing is that they allow for small donations which have a big impact in countries like Syria where the local currency has dropped so considerably.  It's really really sad what's going on over there.  Anyways, even 50 cents goes a long way you know?\n\tPersuadee: Yeah, 50 cents isn't too bad. Maybe I'll consider donating to them\nPersuader: Well, personally, I've made about 8 dollars already here today, so I'm going to donate the 30 cents from this HIT to them.  Did you know that there is an option to do that for this HIT?\n\tPersuadee: No, I didn't know but thank you for telling me! I think I might donate mine too!\nPersuader: I say we do it together!  See, Cassidy, no single one of us can fix all the problems in this world. There is too much suffering, too many children growing up in poverty and trauma.  But together, if we stick together, if we put our money together, you'd be surprised how much we can change in this world.  How many lives we can help.  What do you say, Cassidy, do you want to join me today in helping these kids?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I do, you've really inspired me Tommy\nPersuader: Great!  That's so generous of you.  How much would you like to donate to them today?  Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.  You can choose any amount from  zero to the whole .30 cents.  Personally, I'm giving them the full amount.\n\tPersuadee: I'l do 20 cents\nPersuader: Well thats fantastic of you.  I feel like together we made a small difference in the world today.

Do you have a website?\nPersuader: Yes! Please visit  URL for additional information. But I might be able to answer any questions you have at this time.\n\tPersuadee: I am going to look at it really quick.  How much do people usually donate?\nPersuader: The donations vary. Today, I'm asking for a donation of $5. Of course, anything above that would be greatly appreciated. \n\tPersuadee: Pretty sure I can only donate up to $2\nPersuader: A $2 donation from the heart is better than no donation at all! Your support is greatly appreciated. Did you look over the website?\n\tPersuadee: Honestly everthing I make here goes into my son's college fund.  I was more thinking 50 cents. I did look at the website. looks like a really good cause.\nPersuader: I understand your need to budget for your own children. Please keep in mind that your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. Wouldn't you consider it worth the effort to donate the entire $2 for charity. Your $2 can make all the difference in the lives of these children. $2 could be several meals for a child in need. \n\tPersuadee: I would have to discuss this matter with my wife first.  I am only comfortable with giving 50 cents right now.\nPersuader: Thank you for your continued support and donation. Would you be able to discuss the donation with your wife at this time? I ask because time is essencial. Millions of children are facing the threat of starvation, illness, and homelessness while we speak. \n\tPersuadee: She's not home right now.  But I would be willing to bring this up with my church group and maybe do a fundraiser for this cause.\nPersuader: That would be incredible! Additional support from your church group is much appreciated as well. Again, thank you for your support and commitment to Save the Children. Charitable causes, especially those concerning children and the less fortunate, are definitely the Lord's work! And I know what goes around comes around. And God rewards those that look out for the less fortunate.\n\tPersuadee: Do you know if my donation can specifically go to their US program that help border children?\nPersuader: I believe the funds can be specifically allocated to that designation. I'm happy to hear that you have a passion to help the needs of those children. But there are millions of other children throughout the world that need our assistance. Would you be able to donate $2 directly to those children? I know that especially now, they need all the help they can get. I'm not sure when your children will be going to college, but these kids are in need of help today!\n\tPersuadee: I appreate the info.  I will give 50 cents today and look into a fundraiser with my church group.\nPersuader: I understand. We will accept your 50 cent donation today. Please use the link I provided earlier for additional information to give to you congregation. There is also info on that site as to where to send future donations. \n\tPersuadee: Thanks.  Have a good day!\nPersuader: Again, thank you for being part of the solution. It is greatly appreciated.

{"id": 2760, "data": "Persuader: Hi there, how are you doing today? \n\tPersuadee: Im doing great. you?\nPersuader: I'm doing good. I was wondering if I could talk to you about maybe donating to a charity called Save the Children? \n\tPersuadee: Yes, we can do that.\nPersuader: Great! Save the Children is a fantastic charity that works to ensure that children have access to good healthcare, education, and that they are growing up in a clean and safe environment. It's so important to take care of our children, and this charity really works to help give them the best life possible.\n\tPersuadee: I agree. I think that charity is a good organization that helps children who have low resources\nPersuader: That's great! It's so nice to hear people that really care about this cause too! Would you be willing to donate to the charity today? The donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from 0 to all of your payment. \n\tPersuadee: I think I will choose 0 at this time. Thank you!\nPersuader: I'm so sorry to hear that. The children really need your donation. What can I do to help convince you to make a donation at this time? \n\tPersuadee: I really dont know\nPersuader: I know that 2 dollars seems like a lot for a survey, but think about it. What will you really use that money for? 2 dollars given to this charity can help buy a vaccine for two children. That could mean the life or death for a child.\n\tPersuadee: I know, but I also need the money for gas.\nPersuader: How much money will 2 dollars get you for gas though, when it can literally save someone's life?\n\tPersuadee: I know, but still. I also need the money\nPersuader: Are you sure that this is your final decision? I don't want to call you a selfish person because I don't know you but I'm shocked at how someone can be so callous. This is a survey, yes, but this is a real donation to help save a child's life. \n\tPersuadee: Yet, we are both here to make money. I do not see you donating your compensation.\nPersuader: I actually have donated my entire compensation for this task in order to help. I also donate 20 hours a week with a youth counsel organization to help talk to children with depression and who struggle with substance abuse issues. \n\tPersuadee: I also help at homeless shelters, work at Salvations army without compensation.\nPersuader: And that's great! This is part of my volunteer service, trying to recruit people to donate. Are you sure you won't even donate a quarter to help try to save a child's life? \n\tPersuadee: Nope! Thanks. Maybe you are getting something if I donate, but no.\nPersuader: Would you donate if I could guarantee you that I was not getting any compensation?

There is no way to prove where all those funds go. Plus there are starving children right here in america \nPersuader: This is a great organization and I am sure that they would not be allowed to continue the way they do if the money was not going where it is suppose to and every penny being accounted for.  They do so much good in the world yes there are hungry kids here but millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.\n\tPersuadee: That is all your opinion. You have no facts to back that up.\nPersuader: Yes part of the money does go to pay for things like advertising and all that but over 88% of the donations they recieve are sent where they are needed and that includes in the United States believe it or not.  This is according to a website that breaks down info on different charities\n\tPersuadee: Like I said those are opinions. There are no facts that prove that to be true. There are no laws that stop them from lying to people either. I have never meet anyone who has been aided by that organization. Infomercials don't impress me.\nPersuader: How about the fact that they have been around for over 100 years scams do not stay around that long \n\tPersuadee: Yes they do. Have you ever heard of evangelism?  Again, you're only giving me an opinion.  I just can't see any good being done.\nPersuader: What about the after school programs they have right here in the US or the head start programs that they offer in many rural areas?  Just because it is not happening somewhere that you see everyday does not mean that it does not exsist.  They actually fund the head start that my child will be going to till fall.  Would you be willing to atleast donate some of what you are getting paid for this study?  Right now save the children has a partnership that will double any donation made so any little bit would help\n\tPersuadee: I would not be willing to donate, because I have never seen any impact made by their organization. They also don't disclose their funds\nPersuader: oh see I think I get it now your just selfish and dont care about kids is that about right?  I mean because you personally have never seen it means it does not happen yeah totally.  Stupid\n\tPersuadee: No, I care about  kids in my community, who are in poverty. I have never seen this organization help them. I'd rather contribute my donation locally. Rather than to a scam organization that only contributes in their infomercials. \nPersuader: not to mention where are you getting your information? Saying that they do not disclose funds is an outright lie you can go to  URL s/about-us/resource-library/annual-report and find it all right there. In just one year directly reached nearly 157,000 children through our U.S. emergency response and preparedness programs.I mean did you go talk to the families of the kids in your neighboorhood how you know they are not helping there??? How do you know that nothing in your neighborhood is funded by them?\n\tPersuadee: How long are you going to take to respond? You're making this take far too long!. How does that equate to reporting financial information? That's nothing more than whats said in their infomercials. There are no laws preventing them from lying, but i guess perception is reality too you.\nPersuader: Yeah there is a bunch of infomercial crap on the top but if you download the actual report then you find the actual financial data.  If you would just agree to donate some of your earnings from this hit them it would go much quicker.\n\tPersuadee: You're missing the entire point of what I said if you think downloading that report means something. I will not donate, because i do not trust the charity, and my donations would be better used right here in my own community. \nPersuader: and those local charities they give you their financial info?  There was a shelter in vegas brought in tons of donations cuz they were great yeah right selling any items that were donated and pocketing the cash bigger organizations have more eyes on them\n\tPersuadee: No, but I see the work being done everyday in my community..

How do they go about providing relief to the children?\nPersuader: Well, they provide education, food, and clothing.

I think it is an amazing organization,  but I always like to hear others opinions on charitable organizations.\n\tPersuadee: I think it is a wonderful organization.   I am a teacher and the idea of children suffering is horrible to me.  I love the idea that this organization can reach out and help so many kids that can't help themselves. \nPersuader: Absolutely! And it is amazing how they can stretch their donations to help so many. Literally, the cost of a snack can feed handfuls of children and their families.\n\tPersuadee: I agree it is amazing what they can do. \nPersuader: Have you ever donated to Save the Children or a similar charity?\n\tPersuadee: I have actually donated to Save the Children before.  \nPersuader: Really!? That's awesome. I'm actually going to donate myself. \n\tPersuadee: That's wonderful.  It takes so little to help out these children and make a difference in their lives. \nPersuader: 100% agree. When is the last time you made a donation? Would you be interested in donating again? \n\tPersuadee: It has been a few months, but I am wiling to make another donation.  \nPersuader: Awesome! If you are willing to donate now, your donation can be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2). It's actually a really great thing.\n\tPersuadee: That is a great idea.  I will donate $1\nPersuader: Wonderful! I can only imagine how many mouths that will feed!\n\tPersuadee: I am glad to help.  \nPersuader: The research team is collecting all the donations to send to Save the Children. I'm so glad that we are able to be a part of something so important. Thank you so much for your donation!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you!  Hope you have a great night. \nPersuader: Thank you! Have a wonderful evening!", "label": [[45, 82, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [169, 280, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [520, 532, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [533, 603, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [604, 684, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [749, 813, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [917, 954, "6-SOCIAL-NORMS"], [1094, 1137, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1082, 1093, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1137, 1180, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1283, 1379, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [1380, 1440, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [1439, 1475, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1550, 1600, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1725, 1793, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"]], "idx": "618"}

Chatting is something I'm still not used to doing. \n\tPersuadee: Not me, but it's not enough to interact with new people\nPersuader: I\\'m curious if you have ever heard of an organization called \"Save the Children\"? \n\tPersuadee: The truth is that no, what is it about?\nPersuader: It's a wonderful, international, non-governmental organization that promotes childrens rights and provides relief and support to children in developing countries. \n\tPersuadee: It sounds incredible, and how could one help in that organization?\nPersuader: It is a great charity. One of the things I love about MTurk, is they often allow workers to donate a portion, or even all, of their HIT toward these organizations. I have in the past. \n\tPersuadee:  for real? and how would you look to donate to that charity?\nPersuader: I believe you can agree to donate some or all of this current HIT's payment to Save the Children\n\tPersuadee: I think it's a great idea, there are really people who need it most\nPersuader: Absolutely. I think it's the least we can do for children in impoverished, war torn nations. Would you be willing to donate all of this HITs payment to this organization? I'm donating my entire $2.\n\tPersuadee:  I also, the same opinio, there are people who cost up to $ 1 throughout the week\nPersuader: Here is the website if you need more information.  URL \n\tPersuadee:  thank you very much! Could I also donate clothes and toys?\nPersuader: I think you probably could. I would go to their website to check it out. In the meantime, will you also donate $2 from this HIT to Save the Children? \"The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\"                                \n\tPersuadee:  Yes, I will also donate the $ 2, as I mentioned, the children's happiness is the best there is\nPersuader: Thank you.

{"id": 2796, "data": "Persuader: Do you give to charities?\n\tPersuadee: I do not.\nPersuader: why not?  is it because you don't know much about them?\n\tPersuadee: I usually keep my money to myself. I have donated before to Red Cross, Salvation Army. I give things away other than money, because it is very dear to me. I guess I do kinda give to charities in a way.\nPersuader: That's great. One charity close to my heart is Save the Children - have you heard of them?\n\tPersuadee: I have not.\nPersuader: They are wonderful - I actually work directly with them so I know every penny is used for children oversees who don't have enough food or water.  It's so sad. \n\tPersuadee: That is saddening. Its painful to watch people in other countries struggle to get basic life support to sustain their way of living. \nPersuader: Yes - and just a little money goes a long way.  What they can live on is literally pennies a day!  Sad they don't even have that!\n\tPersuadee: Yeah. I feel you have a question for me.\nPersuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment! you won't even miss it!\n\tPersuadee: You can take half of my task payment. I dislike donating to a charity that I don't know. It would sadden me even more if I found out that I donated to a charity that over pays their higher ups and spends less on the crusade they are trying to help. I hope if this is a real donation that it finds people well.\nPersuader: I feel the same way about distrusting charities but I assure you this one is legit.  I've actually flown to areas and had a child die in my arms because we got there too late!\n\tPersuadee: Well then there we have it. What is our next step?\nPersuader: when this task ends you will be asked about the donation\n\tPersuadee: Very well! Anything else you wanna chat about hah?\nPersuader: just so you know the research team will collect all donations and send it directly!  This is wonderful!\n\tPersuadee: Yes it is wonderful!\nPersuader: You are so great!  Thank you very much!  You will feel great about your donation!  Have a wonderful day!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you. is there a submit button or do I wait for the chat to end?
