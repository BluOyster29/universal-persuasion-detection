It is nice that you do give to charities because every little bit helps. Have you heard of the organization Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes . I've heard about it but I would like to have more information\nPersuader: Sure, they are an international organization not connected to any government that promotes children's rights and provides relief and support to children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Interesting, in how many countries do they work?\nPersuader: Right now they are in 120 countries and have helped 33.3 million children directly. I am partial to children's charities because they help the ones who can't really help themselves.\n\tPersuadee: So nice, what are the main issues they work on? \nPersuader: They provide better healthcare and education for children as well as providing emergency aid when natural disasters occur or war and other conflicts. Did you know in Jan and Feb alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria due to violence in that country?\n\tPersuadee: I've heard about it. It breaks my heart. is this organization clear with its financial reports?\nPersuader: Yes in fact the most recent rating of Save the Children by a non profit charity watchdog gave it an \"A\". I think that is pretty clear.\n\tPersuadee: That is so good to find a trustworthy charities. I think there should be a few well-known companies cooperating with this charity\nPersuader: I agree. I think more people need to get on board to help the children. If we all do a little by sacrificing that 1 coffee a week or by eating out one time less per week, we could all make more of a difference, right?\n\tPersuadee: right, every little help make a big difference. we can support a family with few dollars in some countries\nPersuader: That is true for sure. I'm going to give some of my earnings today to STC, would you be willing to give some also if only $.25?\n\tPersuadee: I guess I will donate even more. I will donate today but can i please have their website in case i want to donate later?\nPersuader: Sure, it is  URL but just know that if you donate through here the research team collects the donations and sends it all to STC so it is above board.\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for the information. Yes I will do it. I am glad there is a chance to help through HITs\nPersuader: Yes definitely. It has been nice chatting with you. You seem like a very kind person. Have a great day and thanks for your help with STC!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for your time and information.

I am here to let you know about this amazing international foundation called Save the Children that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support them in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Please tell me more.\nPersuader:  These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need. All I ask is that you donate a portion of your task payment to this charity to help the children.\n\tPersuadee: How do I know this charity is legit?\nPersuader: You are free to look up any information you like at  URL \n\tPersuadee: How much of the donations goto the children and the effort?\nPersuader: 100% of your donation will go directly to Save the Children. Just think of it this way, instead of getting your morning coffee, or that bag of chips at lunch, you could donate $2 today and help ensure that 3 children get the care they need and food in their stomachs.\n\tPersuadee: Does 100% go to the effort directly or does any of the monies go to employees like the director of the charity ect?\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it all directly to Save the children. So it will go to pay for the flights to get the team over there, medicine, food, everything needed to help these children\n\tPersuadee: What roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?\nPersuader: Like I said earlier, 100% of your donation goes directly to helping these children. Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. They need your help. They need your donation more than you do honestly. What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?\n\tPersuadee: There are many scams out there that take more to profit then to actually help the kids. I need to know these things before I donate even if it is as little as $2.\nPersuader: You can go to the website I provided you earlier to know in your heart that this is not a scam. Can I count on you to help these children? Are you willing to trust me enough to donate your task payment to help these children?\n\tPersuadee: I do not know in my heart that this is not a scam. I have been scammed before. That is why i am asking you for the details. Againwhat  roughly is the percentage that goes to the running of the charity and helping the children directly?\nPersuader:  I went to the website and looked up the actual numbers. 86.5% of donations goes directly to the villages and the rest goes to fund the outreach, website, and publicity. it is a non-profit organization. You don't have to donate the entire amount of your task payment. you can choose any amount from nothing to the $2. I am just hoping you would be gracious to help these children enough to give the $2 and give them a fighting chance. I really believe you know this isn't a scam\n\tPersuadee: How do you donate?\nPersuader: This chat is being recorded, you Tell me how much you would like to donate and I will give it to the research team for them to deduct it from your task payment and send it to Save the Children.

It would help out displaced children facing troubles in Syria. \n\tPersuadee: OH, I AM SO SAD ABOUT THAT NEWS.\nPersuader: You can choose any amount of your donation and will be directly deducted from this task payment.

I know there are a lot of children suffering all over the world, even in first world countries like the United States where there is still drug abuse and sex trafficking.\nPersuader: Of course. Save the Children doesn't just focus on developing countries. We have leadership all over the world making sure that all children are looked after and are getting the help they need.\n\tPersuadee: That's awesome. How long has Save the Children been operating?\nPersuader: Nearly 100 years. It was founded on April 15, 1919, in London, United Kingdom.\n\tPersuadee: Wow, that's a significant amount of time. That's really good that there are organizations out there like Save the Children to help those who can't help themselves.\nPersuader: Yes, our charity ratings are among the best of all charities. \n\tPersuadee: How long have you been working for Save the Children?\nPersuader: A few years. I feel proud to work here.\n\tPersuadee: That's really cool. Have you ever been able to meet any of the kids that you guys have helped?\nPersuader: A few. Usually I see video updates from the people we help. \n\tPersuadee: How does Save the Children provide assistance? i.e do they send out volunteers? or nurses or trained staff to provide the assistance? are they people that live locally in the surrounding area?\nPersuader: Save the Children provided assistance in many ways. If a child is in an area of war and can't go to school, Save the Children will help relocate the child to safer school. If a child is in a danger zone with no food, Save the Children establishes emergency malnutrition units in the hardest hit areas. It is a very large effort for lots of people.\n\tPersuadee: How does someone who wants to have a part in Save the Children join?\nPersuader: A donation is the easiest way to make a large impact. Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need. We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.\n\tPersuadee: It was very nice talking with you. I did not even know Save the Children existed. I'm glad there are people in the world who have the kindness in their hearts to make an impact on the world's littlest population.\nPersuader: Would you like to make a donation\n\tPersuadee: I would, but unfortunately money is tight right now. I will occasionally donate to local animal shelters, but maybe next time I'll consider donating to Save the Children.

Save the Children is responsible for helping innocent children's welfare in deadly war zones, and the recent lack of support has made a lot of children go starving nights, for days even weeks. \n\tPersuadee: that's so sad.

Suggestions on a donation amount?\nPersuader: How about some of the payment from this HIT? Any amount from $0 to all of your payment would help.\n\tPersuadee: Sure, I'm happy to donate half the payment for the HIT\nPersuader: $1 will help a lot, but $2 would really help them reach kids around the world.

Maybe in the future I will be in a better position to help.\nPersuader: Even 0.01 would really help. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children, so there is nothing extra you need to do.\n\tPersuadee: Then I will donate 0.01 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is amazing!

It also helps give children a voice who may not have the rights that children in America have.\n\tPersuadee: Are there specific countries that the charity is focusing on at this time?\nPersuader: Save the Children is active globally in 120 different countries!\n\tPersuadee: That's amazing!

Please tell me more about this charity\nPersuader: This charity is n international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. I have recently donated some money to it.   Would you be interested in how much I donated?\n\tPersuadee: Yes please. And also, was the donation mandatory or voluntary?\nPersuader: I donate about $15 a month and it is all voluntary.  I rather put my money into this charity then church offering because I know it directly helps children.  Would you like to know how I know it helps?\n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a reasonable amount. Sure, tell me more about how it's used\nPersuader: A year ago, I saw kid begging on the street who look really hungry.   I was about to give him some money until a representative for \"Save the Children\" walked ahead of me and help this kid out.   This person took them to their facility and provided food, shelter, and clothing.   A month later I saw the kid was healthier, happy, and cleaner.  I was so impress I decided to make a donation.   Would you be interested in a donation?\n\tPersuadee: Wow. Nice story. I'm very particular about who I donate to so I'd need more information\nPersuader: Understand.   \n\tPersuadee: About how many people a month does the charity help?\nPersuader: Since it is international it helps more then 1000's of kids per month.\n\tPersuadee: And is there a minimum amount required per month (like on of those sponsor a kid charities) or can it be just a one time donation?\nPersuader: No minimum, can be a one time donation.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds doable. Do you know by any chance if this is a registered charity? I want to make sure not all the money is going to the staff via salaries\nPersuader: Its non-governmental but is register to for tax purposes.   Only about 25% goes to the management/staff of the charity.\n\tPersuadee: Okay, that's good to know. I'll make a $20 donation today and keep researching this charity. If it checks out like you say, then I'll consider upping any future donations\nPersuader: This is great.  Thank you for your donation. \n\tPersuadee: No problem.

SO, in order to complete this task, I am supposed to convince you to donate part of your award to Save The Children.\n\tPersuadee: Alright, tell me about that then.\nPersuader: Pretty basic. You can decide between 0-2 dollars to donate. I mean, Save the Children is a well known charity with a really high score for using their donations for actual charitable work\n\tPersuadee: Well I've never been much of a charity person and don't know anything about Charities other than more than a few aren't very truthful about what they do.\nPersuader: Believe me, I understand on that one. Save the Children is really transparent about how they spend their money. Not to mention you can look at several different sites online that rank how truthful charitable organizations are. I have to use these a lot. I am a disabled veteran, and there are a lot of socalled veteran groups out there. \n\tPersuadee: Even then what's really to convince me to make a donation in the first place? I'm not exactly in a great situation myself.\nPersuader: It is your choice, either way. Basically 2 bucks might make a difference to you, but makes a huge difference to a hurting child in another country. I am not going to bug you, if you can't afford it, I respect that.\n\tPersuadee: Well, your goal is to convince me.\nPersuader: True. Pretty much, breaks down like this. Your donation, of any amount, will help children around the world live better lives. The charity is well respected. The amount is small. \n\tPersuadee: Have you donated to the charity before? Yes, the amount may seem small but I'm in need of it too.\nPersuader: Yes, I have. As a matter of fact, I donated a hundred bucks two weeks ago.\n\tPersuadee: And if you, as well as other people are able to do that does the $2 from me really matter that much? Not to mention you probably didn't have to skip a meal to make that donation either.\nPersuader: That is fair. So, if you cannot afford it, choose to donate 0. Charity is a very personal decision.\n\tPersuadee: So you have no other means to try and convince me with?\nPersuader: If I cannot convince you by either checking out the charity yourself, or thinking about making a difference in the lives of poverty stricken children around the world, you probably would not donate no matter how much money you had.\n\tPersuadee: So you believe I am just a selfish person with no desire to help others regardless of how well or poorly I am personally doing?\nPersuader: I did not mean to insult you personally. I am simply saying that I can give you the facts of what the charity is, and what my purpose is for convincing you. If you cannot afford it, I am not making any value judgments based on that. So, how much do you want to donate, 0-2?\n\tPersuadee: I'll just go with a 50/50 split and donate $1. everyone deserves a chance at life.\nPersuader: Awesome.

Have you enjoyed the long weekend?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I did. I did spent it on the beach while doing some barbecue with my friends. It was lot of fun the past couple of days. How was your weekend?\nPersuader: It was relaxing. Sometimes we plan busy weekends but this weekend we stayed home and relaxed. I've actually been reading about Save the Children. Are you familiar with the organization?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I am. It is a very great organization and I believe it was founded by two former presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The organization is charity for the children who have been displaced by either hurricanes or other natural disasters and the charity steps in to help those children and families in need. \nPersuader: Yes. I've always thought it was a worthwhile organization. I think we are all responsible in some way for taking care of the children of the world in whatever way we can.\n\tPersuadee: That is very true because the way that I see it we are all one big family and should be there for one another in a time of crisis and distress.\nPersuader: Yes! I couldn't agree more. We are all in this together. Who knows what we can accomplish if we all do what we can for one another. \n\tPersuadee: Yes. We can accomplish big things if we care for one another and it shouldn't matter what party we are in whether its Democrat, Republican or Green it shouldn't matter. We are all Americans and we are one family. \nPersuader: Once again, I couldn't agree more. I was just reading Save the Children is working in Syria. I'm sad to say, they are reporting over 1000 children have died in 2018 in the war. It's horrific to think of children having to live with this sort of fear. \n\tPersuadee: That is both terrible and sad to hear. Syria has a dictatorship and and someone who is obsessed with power. This is a bad combination because a lot of people and especially the most vulnerable like children are getting caught in the crossfire. Its very sad.\nPersuader: It is sad. I'm thinking about sending them a donation. I don't have much of a budget but I suppose every little be helps. If the millions of people just in the US alone contributed $1, that would be quite an infusion of money for Save the Children. \n\tPersuadee: That is correct. If people in the US contribute $1 for Save the Children the world will be indeed a better place. I will do also give a donation. Children must never live in fear and in horrible conditions that they can't escape from.\nPersuader: According the researchers who's MTurk HIT I'm working on, you could donate right now through this HIT. Your donation could be deducted from your HIT payment. Would you like to commit to donating up to $2 right now?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I willing to commit half of my payment from this Hit. I think it would help many children.\nPersuader: Wonderful! So I can tell them you'll donate $1? They say they will deduct the donations and submit them to Save the Children. \n\tPersuadee: Fantastic.That will be great. I think many lives will be saved if we all contribute to this organization.\nPersuader: I agree! I'll also be making a donation. It was very nice to talk with you! \n\tPersuadee: It was very nice talking to you as well. I hope you have a great week ahead and a great the rest of the year as well.

Are you a sponsor?\nPersuader: Honestly, I am not. But after doing this task and reading up on the website I am going to sign up. I love to do charity work. I also do alot of local volunteer work. Any way I can help a defenseless child I will. I always place my own child in their shoes. That's motivation enough... to picture my babies going through what these kids go through.\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for being so informative and helpful!

Do you have some time to answer some questions for me?\n\tPersuadee: I do have some time to answer questions.\nPersuader: Do you consider yourself to be a charitable person? What type of charities do you donate to?\n\tPersuadee: I do consider myself to be a charitable person. I do not currently donate money because I do not have an income at the moment, however, when I have a bit of extra money, I like to give to St Jude's Children's hospital. I also like to buy food or drinks for homeless people when I see them and have some extra money to do so. \nPersuader: That is generous of you! I understand about only donating if you have a means to. In that case I usually am more willing to volunteer my time. Have you heard of the organization Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I have not heard of that organization before. What is it?\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Oh that's really cool. Can you tell me what kind of children's rights you mean?\nPersuader: Here is a short article about Save the Children's work with children's rights in Armenia:  URL s/what-we-do/where-we-work/greater-middle-east-eurasia/armenia\n\tPersuadee: I understand now. Is this an organization that you like to donate time and money to? \nPersuader: I'm like you, if I have the means I definitely would. I usually can't donate much, just a dollar or so, but everything helps and anything is better than nothing.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah I definitely understand that. Right now all the money I have is going into savings for my own little person who's on the way. \nPersuader: Oh congratulations! I don't have any children, but all my extra money has been going towards student loan debt. Do you think that you could do $0.25?\n\tPersuadee: I really wish that I could, but between my own student loans and the credit debt that I have had to incur while going to appointments and such while unemployed, I really need every last cent to get myself financially stable.\nPersuader: I understand. I don't want to be pushy. Is there anything else you would like to know about the organization Save the Children so you could make an informed decision to donate in the future when you are in a better situation to donate?\n\tPersuadee: So I looked at things like the US children coming across the boarder, but do they do things like bringing food and medical equipment to children in other countries?\nPersuader: Yes, they do a lot of emergency response work. No one knows when the next earthquake, flood or tsunami will strike. But we do know children are severely affected by natural disasters. They also suffer greatly during conflict, drought and disease outbreaks. Save the Children's natural disaster response and emergency relief programs help protect vulnerable boys and girls during disasters and their aftermath.\n\tPersuadee: Oh that's really cool. I love learning new things about the medical field so it is always nice to learn about someone that brings things like basic medial equipment to places that need them.\nPersuader: I don't want to take up too much of your time, but here is an article that might interest you:  URL s/about-us/media-and-news/2018-press-releases/yemen-hundreds-of-thousands-children-at-risk-hodeidah-attack   Thank you for talking with me and have a great day!", "label": [[11, 36, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [91, 119, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [120, 174, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [239, 290, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [291, 331, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [681, 706, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [706, 763, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [763, 823, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [824, 877, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [959, 1127, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1231, 1388, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1498, 1551, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1552, 1659, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [1815, 1835, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1835, 1927, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1927, 1964, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [2213, 2227, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2227, 2252, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2253, 2448, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [2637, 2683, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [2684, 2752, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [2753, 2820, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [2821, 2893, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [2893, 3046, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [3261, 3467, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [3470, 3521, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"]], "idx": "202"}
{"id": 2223, "data": "Persuader: Hello.\n\tPersuadee: Hello!\nPersuader: I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people. Is that okay?  To talk about suffering people and children for a minute?\n\tPersuadee: I will have no discomfort discussing suffering people.\nPersuader: I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.  If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.  \n\tPersuadee: I feel really torn about the crisis.  I don't think the weight of that burden should fall on the rest of the worlds shoulders.  At the same time as a parent I would want the best possible future for my children and I know fiercly that I would do everything in my power to make sure they were in a safe place.\nPersuader: I actually didn't think of it like that.  I am a parent too, it feels so foreign what they are going through.  This whole chat thing is supposed to get me to get you to donate to Save the Children, but now I think they got me to do it instead! I don't know if that's really okay to do though. \n\tPersuadee: I always wonder how much of donations actually go where ear marked. I see on the local level how much of donations stay local and what gets spent on things I would call \"stupid\".  I am always worried if I donate it will just go to some higer up that is living the high life.  Sorry Im getting off topic.\nPersuader: No, that's relevant. Really relevant. It's really easy to get cynical about life and if people really benefit from any of this.  I usually donate in hopes I can at least feel like I did my part.  If I donated and some corrupt person took it, that's the worst karma and even worst scandal imaginable.  The people who donate and people who are worrying about that are the same people.  You're not a horrible person it sounds like, just worried if what you do even matters.  \n\tPersuadee: With that all said I do feel like any orginazation that aims to help the children I am more inclined to donate to them than most.  My boss has a sponsored child that she sends money to every month.  SHe picked out a child with the same birth month as one of her kids.  I think helping children is an important thing as they are our future!\nPersuader: I feel like you are smart enough and definitely moral enough to be the boss.  I hope you have success  in your field. I don't have that great of a job or boss but I'd still  I would like to match a donation with you if you're willing to try help kids with me.  I am parent and I feel like I need extra help sometimes too , but knowing that I could REALLY help them makes feel like a better parent.\n\tPersuadee: I think donating to this cause would def be a step in the right direction to hopefully helping across the world the children that are in dispair.  They are the weak ones in my eyes.\nPersuader: I don't want you to donate any more than you want, so if you want to donate how much do you to do? I think any amount you give (especially more) will definitely help and I want you to know that it would be deducted from you task payment. Whatever you choose to do or the amount you want to give, I feel like you've changed my mind about charity, not the other way around, so I want to thank you for that.\n\tPersuadee: I think its just the perspective of the person but we all inheriently want to help as much as we can.  I would donate half of this hit payment to this charity and feel good about it I think.\nPersuader: If you're doing this task then you might be able to afford it, but if you can I'd probably say you should really donate it all just this one time.  So whatever you donate I can donate as well, and can actually help each other donate to the kids.  You want to match all our payment to Save the Children? Would that be okay? Or should we lock in your half payment?\n\tPersuadee: I think I would feel good about half and if you are inclined to donate as well that would be fabulous.  I would lock into half.\nPersuader: Sure let's do it. I might donate a little more I don't know how to do that but, I think they deserve it, I'm convince by talking to you that people regardless of how they feel about refugees that they can still care about kids. \n\tPersuadee: I agree if we don't take care of the kids we risk losing a whole generation of people!\nPersuader: Oh, I didn't think of it like that either.  I always picture like you said about your boss, one kid.  But you're right it's a whole generation, that's A LOT of people.  I always forget that kids turn into adults, i mean not that part, but the whole part where they are all apart of the community! :)\n\tPersuadee: Thanks for talking me thru this today!

Did you know each dollar you donate will be doubled by the organization?\n\tPersuadee: I did not know that\nPersuader: Every day, 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, mostly from preventable causes. Were you aware of this fact?\n\tPersuadee: I was not aware of that fact, no.\nPersuader: Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve. We're talking about children in need. Dying, when the world knows how to save them. Vulnerable children in poverty. Denied an education. Forced to flee violence. Orphaned, abused, abandoned. Children with no reason to smile. No hope for the future.  The world's children deserve better and you're making a difference. How much will you spend on a snack or a drink today? Then ask yourself how much of that could have saved a life.\n\tPersuadee: well, I've already promised 10.  My families poor too and I don't get a lot of extra stuff like drinks and snacks.  It's not easy for me to give anything and no charity has ever helped me.  I wonder how much their CEO makes for saving the children.  I'm guessing a lot more than me.\nPersuader: I can certainly understand where you are coming from, and family does come first. Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty. When you focus on children in rural America, that number jumps to 1 in 4. Through our education, protection and emergency programs, we reached 638,000 kids in 2016 alone. May I confirm our donation agreement is in fact $10 ?\n\tPersuadee: It is in fact 10 or 5% of my weekly income.  can I confirm that you would also like to donate 5% of yours?\nPersuader: If you agree to donate $10, then I can as well. I could not ask something of someone I would not do myself.\n\tPersuadee: I understand that we will both be donating.  I hope it is helpful to the children\nPersuader: You are a part of the solution and you do not have to hope it is helpful. Your $10 donation will be matched by Save the Children\n\tPersuadee: ok, got it.  cheers\nPersuader: I just looked it up and the manager side of the charity splits 5% if you're interested in that.\n\tPersuadee: I think charities would recieve a lot more if the country would go after the 1% to help\nPersuader: If I had all the control, the only money not spent on the children would be for fundraising. Thank you very much for your $10 donation to Save the Children. \n\tPersuadee: no problem.  thanks", "label": [[11, 91, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [149, 153, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [153, 237, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [314, 385, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [385, 442, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [442, 514, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [558, 648, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [648, 676, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [734, 827, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [828, 866, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [866, 912, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [912, 944, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [944, 964, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [965, 989, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [990, 1018, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1019, 1053, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1053, 1077, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1078, 1145, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [1146, 1198, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1199, 1258, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1565, 1647, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1647, 1734, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [1735, 1808, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1809, 1905, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1906, 1959, "2-NEGOTIATE-REMIND"], [2090, 2137, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"], [2138, 2197, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2303, 2376, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [2377, 2431, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"], [2475, 2570, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [2682, 2774, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2775, 2839, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"]], "idx": "208"}

I agree that it's a great organization.\nPersuader: It absolutely is! Unfortunately, as with any charitable organization, they do rely on donations and community support to continue providing the resources they do. Without our help, they may not be able to help the children fully. I know there's all kinds of charities nowadays, but trustworthy organizations that advocate for children really touch my heart. I can't ignore them. What about you?\n\tPersuadee: I agree. We have a number of charities here, but it's necessary to check them out carefully because there are a few that are scams or have extremely high administrative costs. I think that the charities for children are the most deserving. Do you donate to Save the Children?\nPersuader: Oh yes I understand. I donate whenever I can (to various charities) and I've certainly been scammed before. I agree, charities for children are most deserving. I have donated to Save the Children and I would again. They're quite a reputable organization that is recognized and utilized domestically and internationally.

Furthermore, it rates a variety of charities so you can see any type. It's quite thorough as well, providing contact info as well as in depth statistical analysis of their results (not just in dollars but in people helped). I definitely know it's not always possible. I work but it's check to check. I do find some opportunities here and there it's always a pleasure. Would you have any interest in donating earnings from this task?

How much of your earnings would you like to donate to the charity?\n\tPersuadee: It's tough living on $2 a day. Not any wiggle room for unexpected occurances in life like illness or school fees. I would be willing to donate all my earnings if you agree with that.\nPersuader: I understand completely. And I genuinely thank you for offering your survey payment as a donation.

But it's good to know at lease one organization tries to help the most in need.  Did you know that they accept donations from mturk?  So we could donate directly to them from our funds for this HIT.  Even small amounts go a long way when so many people donate.\n\tPersuadee: I can donate 50 cents right now, the rest goes into my childs college fund\nPersuader: Ok. That sounds great.  I'm going to donate a similar amount myself\n\tPersuadee: sounds good, it is always worthwhile to donating something, nothing is too small\nPersuader: I agree.  Especially with how many people are participating.  If everybody in America gave 1 dollar today, that would be 370 million.  It's amazing how many adds up\n\tPersuadee: Plus who doesn't want to help children?\nPersuader: Exactly.  Well, you take care and enjoy the rest of your holiday. It was nice chatting with you\n\tPersuadee: Nice chatting with you too.", "label": [[11, 15, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [16, 34, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [137, 167, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [167, 208, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [210, 224, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [225, 243, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [314, 320, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [321, 465, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [584, 590, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [787, 874, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [966, 1040, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [1198, 1242, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1244, 1361, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1465, 1481, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1482, 1543, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1814, 1853, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1854, 1921, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1923, 2002, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [2123, 2183, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [2282, 2304, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [2306, 2349, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"], [2454, 2463, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [35, 69, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [130, 136, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [466, 481, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [481, 514, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [592, 668, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [757, 787, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [874, 966, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1041, 1087, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1148, 1154, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1154, 1196, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1361, 1391, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1543, 1703, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1800, 1813, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [2004, 2055, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [2057, 2121, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [2464, 2514, "6-SOCIAL-GROUP"], [2693, 2747, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2516, 2587, "6-SOCIAL-GROUP"], [2589, 2618, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [2682, 2691, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [2748, 2777, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"]], "idx": "224"}
