Do you love helping children that are in need? \n\tPersuadee: Hi, I am good, and yes, I do like helping children in need.\nPersuader: Have you ever heard of the Charity organization called Save the Children? Would you like to hear more about it?\n\tPersuadee: I have heard of the charity, I wouldn't mind hearing more about it.\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps children in developing countries. Isnt it heartbreaking to see how children in developing countries suffer compared to those here in the U.S.\n\tPersuadee: It is sad that children suffer in other parts of the world.\nPersuader: At least their is a charitable organization that advocates for these children. Unfortunately, not enough people donate this cause. \n\tPersuadee: It is good that there are charities to address important causes.\nPersuader: Yes, there is I plan on donating to this cause. It is true that every cent helps, even if it is just pennies.\n\tPersuadee: I agree that every little bit helps.\nPersuader: If every person in the US gave just a penny it would make a husge difference. Unfortunately that is unrealistic.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, it would be hard to get everyone to donate, even if it was just a penny.\nPersuader: What about yourself? Would you be willing to donate a small amount to this charity?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I would be willing to donate a small amount to the charity.\nPersuader: Would you be willing to donate fifty cent of your profit from this task if it was guaranteed to go to Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I would donate fifty cents from this task if it was guaranteed to go to Save the Children.\nPersuader: Thank you that is wonderful!

{"id": 3066, "data": "Persuader: hello\n\tPersuadee: Hello\nPersuader: I\\'d like to take this opportunity to ask for some help with a non-profit organization that\\'s seek financial help.  it\\'s called \"Save the children\".  Can I have a moment of your time?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, what would you like to tell me\nPersuader: Save the children is seeking donations which helps ensure children's rights to health, education, safety, etc.  Any donation you may offer will make a tangible impact for the world.\n\tPersuadee: Ok. How much of my donation actually reaches the children, and how much is used to pay for administrative purposes?\nPersuader: Since this is a nonprofit organzation all donations will go directly to a trustable fund.  There are no payments toward adminstrative purposes.  Once the funds reach a certain limit (from various donators) they will then be used to purchase supplies, food, etc all for the children\n\tPersuadee: Is safe the children only children in America?\nPersuader: No, this is a worldwide cause.  In the first 2 months of 2018 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intesifying violence, largely in part to them being located in war zones in Syria.\n\tPersuadee: I want to help American children as well, will they receive any aid?\nPersuader: Yes they will.  The mission of \"Save the children\" is to assist ALL children.  Here in America we have children (unfortunately) dying due to hunger.  Your donation will help to purchase them food and allow them to receive the proper education needed.\n\tPersuadee: What type of payment will you accept?\nPersuader: Payments can be made via through our secured website  URL  You can donate using a credit/debit card\n\tPersuadee: So you wouldn't be able to accept a check?\nPersuader: For checks you will have to call  1.800.728.3843  where they will give further details \n\tPersuadee: Ok, I'll donate. Can you send me the link again?\nPersuader: sure..... URL   Thank you so much for expressing interest in our cause, your donation will be greatly appreciated\n\tPersuadee: What's the average donation size\nPersuader: There really isn't an average donation size, however think of those times when you are out shopping and happen to purchase unnecessary items.  By adding the costs of those things ie. bag of chips, candy, etc. are perfect examples of what a donation can be\n\tPersuadee: That sounds great, I'll visit the site\nPersuader: Awesome, thanks again.", "label": []}

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.\n\tPersuadee: you can donate 0$ to 2$ from this hit\nPersuader: Save the Children is a professional organization and has many credentials.

Watching the UCF-UConn game and doing some Turks.\n\tPersuadee: Who are you cheering for?\nPersuader: UCF.  Last year\\'s \"National Champions\"\n\tPersuadee: I went to UCF for a semester.

I work downtown for The Dr. Phillips Center, a non profit performing arts center.\n\tPersuadee: I'm originally from Tampa. Moved to Texas about 2 years ago. \nPersuader: Cool.  Don't mess with Texas, right?  So speaking of non-profits, would you be interested in donating some of your bonus from this HIT to Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Can you tell me about it?\nPersuader: Sure.  Save the Children gives children a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. When crisis strikes, they are always among the first to respond and the last to leave. They do whatever it takes to save children, transforming their lives and the future we all share.  They are a worldwide organization and I believe even assisted with the response to Hurricane Harvey in Houston last year.\n\tPersuadee: So they are a crisis response organization?\nPersuader: Yup.  They are helping out with the Syrian refugee crisis, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the earthquakes in Japan, the earthquake in Haiti a few years ago... even as far back as Katrina.\n\tPersuadee: How much of the donation goes directly to the children?\nPersuader: 100% of your donation goes to it according to the creators of this Turk.  You can donate any amount of your bonus and the rest of the bonus is yours to keep.  I even use a Chome extension call Tabs for a Cause and donate to them through that extension all the time\n\tPersuadee: No non profit can give 100% of the donation to the intended recipient. There are costs to take care of first.\nPersuader: Yeah, that\\'s true.  The only information I have to work with in regards to how much of this particular donation that goes to the children is what the research organizers say: \"The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\"  However, according to Charity Navigator, 88.3% of their donations go to their mission (the children).\n\tPersuadee: Without time to do more research, I don't think I'll donate.\nPersuader: Not even 50 cents?  44 of which will go to those kids?  Don't make me start playing the Sarah McLachlan music with the children in the background because the researchers gave me the ability to do that...\n\tPersuadee: No, I like to completely research any causes I donate to.\nPersuader: \"I will remember youuuuuuuuuu... *sad child from Hurricane Harvey\"  \"Will you remember meeeee?\" *sad child from earthquake*", "label": []}

We help out poor children.  We assist in all sorts of ways.   Education, health care, vaccinations etc.  We cover all aspects of it.

Would you like to spend $1.70 to help some poor children today.\n\tPersuadee: Well being that im kind of a poor person myself im kind of in the same boat as the children lol. I'd be fine with donating $1.00 though and i'd keep the other.\nPersuader: But think of all of the poor children.

Admistration etc.  We have people working full time who distribute funds and keep the programs going.  We have to do a lot of vetting to ensure the money isn't wasted and is distributed properly\n\tPersuadee: Makes sense you gotta keep the engine running. Well I hope that my $1.10 helps those poor children and when i dont need to rely on HITs for money i'd love to donate more.\nPersuader: For just a mere $1.25 you can save a child's life.\n\tPersuadee: Finnnnnne take the $1.25.
