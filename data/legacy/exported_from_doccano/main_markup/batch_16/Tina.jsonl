I feel confident that my money goes to the right places.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I like to help whenever I can when it comes to children. They are helpless.\nPersuader: That's great! So do you think you'd be willing to make a donation?\n\tPersuadee: Do you make donations on line or mail it in?\nPersuader: You can actually donate directly\n\tPersuadee: Where, on their website?\nPersuader: I'm sorry my last message was cut off. You can actually make a donation directly from this task!\n\tPersuadee: Ok, I would like to. Maybe ten dollars I can do.\nPersuader: That would be an incredible donation that could really go a super long way for save the children!\n\tPersuadee: Ok, I will definitely help out.\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your generosity. On behalf of Save The Children, THANK YOU! you should be prompted on a following screen to donate and you can enter your donation there :) Have a great day!", "label": [[11, 14, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [157, 217, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [360, 446, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [846, 850, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1320, 1334, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [15, 39, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [40, 104, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [328, 359, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [596, 734, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [851, 904, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [905, 976, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1056, 1158, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1158, 1215, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1334, 1386, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1455, 1487, "2-NEGOTIATE-REMIND"], [1705, 1802, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1940, 2053, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1536, 1574, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1575, 1632, "2-NEGOTIATE-REMIND"], [1858, 1896, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1897, 1939, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"]], "idx": "74"}
{"id": 3034, "data": "Persuader: Hello, How are you doing?\n\tPersuadee: I am doing wonderfully, how about yourself?\nPersuader: Good. I am doing great. Would you like to know how you could make a difference, even if it is with a small monetary donation?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, please tell me more about your charity.\nPersuader: Well the charity that I represent is Save the Children. It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: I just saw an ad for this last evening on tv. Where are you located?\nPersuader: Alabama. If you like to help you can donate to them, it does not have to be a lot. Small amount all build up to a greater good, so you do not have to feel guilty when you donate a small amount. \n\tPersuadee: Can you tell me exactly what kind of support they can provide? What is your role in this charity?\nPersuader: Well I am just a volunteer who is passionate about the cause the organization provides to many children who would otherwise not have access to the resources that Save the Children provides to them. They provide book, educational materials, and health care to the children. Save the Children has had opportunities to go into war-torn areas to help PTSD children recover from the side-effects of war. \n\tPersuadee: Are the donations tax deductible?\nPersuader: Yes, all donations are deductible. After the donation is processed you will be emailed or sent a copy of the donation and you can use that for your tax documents. \n\tPersuadee: WHat is the best way to make a donation?\nPersuader: You can donate with their website at  URL  At the top there is a link for donations where it is all streamlined. \n\tPersuadee: I am not too trusting of giving my personal information on-line. Will there be another way to donate?\nPersuader: Well you can call them at 1.800.728.3843. But I can assure you that their donation portal is very secure with McAfee Security.\n\tPersuadee: That is somewhat reassuring. Can you tell me what the average donation is? \nPersuader: Usually $25 is a average donation because it is not too much yet it can be just enough to know that your donation is going to a good cause. But there is a button where you can choose however much you want to donate so there is not pressure to donate a lot. \n\tPersuadee: Great. Now, the instructions regarding this chat indicate that I can donate from my payment for chatting with you. Does this mean mturk or save the children will automatically be paid if I decide to donate my payment, meaning I do not have to do anything more?\nPersuader: Yes that is correct. I will not see how much you will donate but you can donate through this chat function.\n\tPersuadee: Well, thank you for all the good information. I do not choose to donate right now through this chat but be assured that I will certainly call the charity and donate independently. Thanks for your time, nice chatting with you\nPersuader: It is unfortunate that you cannot donate right now but I can understand. Hopefully you can find it in your heart to donate in the future.

How long have you been doing it?\nPersuader: I've been working this for almost two years now. The busier season is starting as the colleges in the US will be started/starting soon so that helps\n\tPersuadee: So obviously it's worth it for you.  Do you just do it in your spare time?\nPersuader: Yea it's definitely worth it to me. I do some at my work on days when its slow but mostly just in my off time instead of going on social media or something I come here\n\tPersuadee: I guess it's a lot better way to waste time than seeing what a bunch of people I don't really care about are doing.  So when college is in there's less competition?  \nPersuader: Haha exactly! When college is in session we get more studies/surveys posted as a lot of the work on Turk is done for academic reasons. So in the next couple weeks we'll see an influx of students doing their psychology studies and such via the platform.\n\tPersuadee: Oh man, I didn't even think of that.  They have all the grant money to throw out too.  So how much time do you throw at this in a given week?\nPersuader: It varies but generally a few hours on my workdays and maybe like 6 or 8 on my days off I'd say\n\tPersuadee: That's pretty good.  I don't have that kind of time.  Any suggestions for a newcomer?\nPersuader: On the task page sort so you see the newest HITs, and grab whatever looks good to you as far as surveys. I'd recommend being wary of doing multiple HITs for any 1 requestor until you vet them yourself because rejections early on in a Turk account can make getting better hits tough (a lot of the better hits require 99% or higher approval rating) - and remember you'll get a lot faster at it as you keep going, it can feel a bit slow and tough at the beginning but it does get better\n\tPersuadee: Thanks, the last few days have been pretty boring, I was hoping to see more progress.  Are sureveys the way to go?  I've seen a lot of the website searching stuff too?  Is that stuff worth it?\nPersuader: Website searching can be good, it never hurts to try a HIT once - see how fast you can complete it and decide if it\\'s worth doing more from there. One other cool thing about MTurk is that some studies allow you to donate money to a charitable cause directly from the task payment - This one we\\'re doing now in fact allows us to donate towards a foundation called \"Save the Children\"\n\tPersuadee: Oh really?  Where do you see that?\nPersuader: At the end of the study they will ask if you'd like to donate from your payment to the foundation, they assist needy children all around the globe in dire situations. Would you be willing to donate any of your payment today to help save the kids?\n\tPersuadee: I think so.  How do you see where the donation goes?  \nPersuader: It will tell you in a short blurb above the box to donate (I've done this HIT before in the past) and the researchers ensure 100% of any amount you donate goes to the kids.

I know a lot of organizations do amazing work overseas - they are one that focuses specifically on helping ensure children have rights to education, health, and safety\n\tPersuadee: I have never heard of them actually, but thats awesome! Education, health and safety are key points that I think are very important to the less fortunate children overseas.\nPersuader: I agree - certainly important for everyone, but often its the kids who can\\'t speak for themselves that have the hardest time accessing the things they need. Between working with immediate disaster relief (like post hurricane Harvey) or longer term issues - like improving access to clean water in Cambodia, and they are on the \"Wise Giving\" award from Better Business Bureau - which measures how well funds get to the charitable work (versus expensive staff, etc)\n\tPersuadee: Wow. I actaully never knew that the BBB had such a thing to measure that sort of implication. I do know in fact that many NGO's out there do not use the money for the actual mission they are seeking. \nPersuader: I think that's why BBB set it up - it's an accreditation for charities to make sure people know how funds are being spent.

EVEN THOUGH WE ARE NOT FINANCIALLY WELL OFF GIVE A SINGLE DOLLAR IS HELP THEM TO SATISFIED FOR FOOD\n\tPersuadee: Yeah definitely. President Obama did the same sort of thing with \"Grassroots\" Fundraising. Instead of getting a few really large donations, he was able to get several millions of small donations to fund his presidential campaign. It shows the power of small amounts of money.
