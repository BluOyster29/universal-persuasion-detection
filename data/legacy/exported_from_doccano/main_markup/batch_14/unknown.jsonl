Have you ever made a donation to them?\nPersuader: Yes, I try to make a donation at least annually\n\tPersuadee: Nice! How much do they recommend you donate?\nPersuader: I would suggest around $20.  That is enough to signifigantly help a child for several weeks while it is just a week's worth of coffee for you.\n\tPersuadee: I could definitely justify giving $20 to them.\nPersuader: Your donation would be of great help and most would go directly to helping these kids.  Meanwhile, you could feel great about helping those kids who really need your support!\n\tPersuadee: Sounds good, do I just go to the website to donate?\nPersuader: Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.  You can do that right now.  How much would you likfe to donate?\n\tPersuadee: I will just go ahead and do the $20.\nPersuader: Ok. The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! I am glad I found a charity I can support.\nPersuader: That great and thanks for your generousity!\n\tPersuadee: No problem. I always like to help when I can.\nPersuader: You are a good person.

I try to leave money for the Salvation Army when they are around during the holidays.\n\tPersuadee: I don't have money to donate. That's why I'm on Mturk\nPersuader: I can relate, I have been trying to put a decent amount of hits together all weekend. Would you be interested in donating just a small amount of your bonus from this hit to Save the Children, even a few cents can make a difference.\n\tPersuadee: OK 5 cents\nPersuader: That's great! Every little bit helps.\n\tPersuadee: Ok 5 cents. I think we've reached our turn limit. GL with your hits\nPersuader: We have to have 10 responses...\n\tPersuadee: But they also say they shouldn't be meaningless so I'm not sure what to do\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children, knowing that the donations go directly to the charity, would you be willing to give.06 cents?\n\tPersuadee: 5 cents is all I'm willing to give. \nPersuader: Ok, that is great, I just wanted to give you a bit more information about what Save the Children is fighting against.... For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. \n\tPersuadee: I don't think children should go through that. But I'm not the kind of person who can be donating money. Mturk is the only thing I have time to do \nPersuader: I agree, it is sad that children go through it and it is good to know that while we struggle here, even our small donations when combined can really make a difference.\n\tPersuadee: I don't think our ten cents is really going to make a difference to be honest. But I can spare a nickel I guess\nPersuader: We all do what we can, good luck today :)\n\tPersuadee: I think it's a bit unethical of them to put us in this situation on mturk of trying to get us to donate.

All those coins really add up!\n\tPersuadee: I imagine it does, how about you\nPersuader: I sponsor a little boy in India. It's about $40 a month. I would sponsor so many more, but it's really all I can afford.\n\tPersuadee: That's quite the humanitarian effort, good on you\nPersuader: Thanks! It's really gratifying. They send me pictures and videos of him and his family, and let me know exactly where my money is going. I was hoping you would be interested in supporting another great organization, Save the Children. They are also really trustworthy. Your donation to them helps ensure children's right to health, education, safety, etc.\n\tPersuadee: My willingness to donate to charities is always reliant on my current financial situation, currently my finances are fairly unstable and I need every penny that I can scrounge up. Perhaps in the future when I have more disposable income I would be willing to undertake such a proposal, but sadly right now I cannot.\nPersuader: I know exactly how you feel. I've been sick with cancer for about 12 years now. We pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. But I felt so useless sometimes, I decided I would make it work. So I do these little side jobs in order to pay for sponsoring my Indian boy.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, paycheck to paycheck, the story of my life, and imagine doing this in order to eat, But that's not what we are here to discuss, we need to come to some sort of resolution about this donation. How do we go about that?\nPersuader: Well, just so you know, they are not looking for a large donation. You can donate any amount, up to your total payment, which will be $2 after bonus. Even just 5 cents would be acceptable. Would that be okay with you?\n\tPersuadee: Sure 5 cents is fine\nPersuader: That's awesome.

I am not extremely familiar with them, but I have seen several ads for them.\nPersuader: It is a big organization saving the children in almost 120 countries. are you interested in donating?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I would be happy to donate to that charity. Do you have an amount in mind?\nPersuader: Not any specific amount, anything can be good, no matter small or big. I usually donate to big organizations myself, and I have a soft heart for children\n\tPersuadee: I do, too. I tend to find it easy to be sympathetic towards several different types of charities. From what I have seen about Save the Children I've always been impressed with the work they do.\nPersuader: Same here, Specially when i see how they are clear with their financial and how they try to help all children all around the world\n\tPersuadee: I agree. I feel much better donating to places where I feel confident that the money  is going to where they say it will. I think Save the Children is the biggest charity of it's kind.\nPersuader: Same here, It is also nice when I can donate anonymously. It makes my heart happy how people know about these organization and they actually donate\n\tPersuadee: I'm like you. I always try to donate anonymously. I don't feel the need to be recognized for any good I can do.\nPersuader: Same here, and I like how some HITs encourage us to donate. I've been donating more since I've started working on MTurk.\n\tPersuadee: That's funny that you mention that. I always wonder how many people donate any bonuses that are offered to them. I always donate most if not all of any money I am offered. I figure that I wasn't expecting it to begin with so better to do some good however much.\nPersuader: I donate most of my bonus when I can, I feel like it is free money and others deserve it more. The good thing about it is when you want to donate on websites they usually have a minimum, but with HITs there is no minimum amount\n\tPersuadee: Yes, some of these Universities really impress me with how much they are willing to donate. I know some of them get  really large amounts for studies and I appreciate when they use the money to do some good while gaining research.\nPersuader: Exactly and they pay to workers good enough so they will be willing to donate. It is worth a lot.

I am curious of what you think about world-wide charity organizations and if you have ever heard of Save The Children?\n\tPersuadee: I think that certain organizations have a very important role to play when directed in the right fashion. I believe I have heard of save the children. Is that the organization that prioritizes funding for children without homes?\nPersuader: Yes that is part of what they do, for instance the refugee crisis in Syria, this organization commits to saving these children from the daily threat of violence.  But that is just an example.\n\tPersuadee: I actually work with some organizations that do similar work to this on a smaller more local scale. The United Way Foundation was founded in my city and we give donations through work\nPersuader: Oh nice!  I want to say it's Denver or Chicago but I don't remember lol.  Anyways, the website is  URL if you would like to check it out.\n\tPersuadee: Thanks I'll look at it. Do you work with them?\nPersuader: I do not, but I am an advocate for their cause.  If you are comfortable with donating up to $2 of your bonus, you may, the researchers will take the amount you specify out of your bonus.\n\tPersuadee: Do you know any more information about where the money specifically goes to?\nPersuader: I personally do not, though I have seen concrete evidence through unbiased sources that save the children does do charitable work.  If you ever heard the term, \"save a child for a cup of coffee\"  it came from them.\n\tPersuadee: Definitely. And I am not doubting that they do good work I was just curious about how they allocate their donations. Going back to the United Way I mentioned earlier they actually let you decide where your donations get put to work. If you would like them to choose for you they have a community fund.\nPersuader: Oh I get that, I guess that will be in the hands of the researchers themselves.  I am sure save the children allows specific donations to go to specific needs, but you would be donating through a \"3rd party\" so to speak.  Would you like to contribute?\n\tPersuadee: You said up to $2 but my payment for this is only $0.30 so I am not sure how this works\nPersuader: Oh, there is a bonus of $2 for completing this task, after we speak there will be a section where you can designate how much you would like to donate.\n\tPersuadee: I see. That makes more sense. I will most likely donate some of the bonus then. That makes it easy\nPersuader: Very nice, I will match whatever amount you declare here, how about that?\n\tPersuadee: Sure that works.

Especially childrens charities, children are so innocent and deserve the best chance at life.\n\tPersuadee: But do you really trust the charities that you give to? Do you know if they are actually using that money for the intended purpose?\nPersuader: YEs I always look into the charities that i donate to. For instance I always donate to our local childrens hospital because my nephew was treat there when he was diagnosed with cancer. I saw how many sick little kids where there fight for their lives. So I also donate to the hospital and childrens cancer network because the money goes directly to research cancers that effect children.\n\tPersuadee: I agree, the local charities are good. I don't trust the bigger charities. I think most of the money that is donated goes towards salaries, etc.\nPersuader: Sadly that is true some times. How do you feel about donating to childrens charities?\n\tPersuadee: I think it is better to help children yourself. That way, you know what the money is being used for. Also, when you do it yourself, it is a lot more rewarding.\nPersuader: True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs. We are lucky to have help if needed they have no one to turn to.\n\tPersuadee: How much do you usually donate every year>\nPersuader: I try to donate at least 250 every year. \n\tPersuadee: That is good. Do you have any kids?\nPersuader: Yes, I have two and I have a lot of nephews and nieces, 1 has a lot of  health issues so childrens charities are always important to me. Do you have children?\n\tPersuadee: I do not have any children yet, do you think that having kids had a big effect on whether on not you are willing to donate to a children's charity?\nPersuader: Yes, probably but my nephew got sick before I had kids and thats what made me realize that cancer or any illness can happen to anyone whether its your child or some one close to you. It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child. Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.\n\tPersuadee: That is a great way to think about it. I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well. So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children. What do you think?\nPersuader: Yes I am fine with that\n\tPersuadee: It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference. If half the people in the world just donated 10 cents to such charities, then we would raise a LOT of money. It is not necessary to donate hundreds of dollars.\nPersuader: Yes that is what I believe to, We wouldn't even notice 10 cents we spend so much on coffee little things the .10 cents is nothing.\n\tPersuadee: Agreed.

No, we work all around the world, wherever our help is needed.\n\tPersuadee: What a great charity, is there anything I can do to help?\nPersuader: Absolutely, we are always looking for individuals who are willing to contribute to the cause.\n\tPersuadee: How much are you looking for?\nPersuader: A donation of just $1 can help feed a child for 5 days.\n\tPersuadee: And specifically, where does that money go towards?\nPersuader: The money goes towards providing meals and clean water.\n\tPersuadee: I'd be interested in donating to your cause\nPersuader: That's great!

Even a quarter would help.\n\tPersuadee: I don't know anything about this charity.  I don't even know if it is a real charity.  Seems like something someone made up for this HIT. \nPersuader:  URL ( \"The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\")\n\tPersuadee: Ok that looks real to me lol.  Still not sure I want to donate to it though.  It is hard to earn money on mTurk and I don't want to give any of it away.  \nPersuader: Well take a look at the website, I know money is hard to come by on Mturk. \n\tPersuadee: The website does have a strong appeal, I will give it that.  I am already 20 minutes into this HIT though and earning less than 2 dollars for that time would be a waste for me.  So, I am not going to donate.  \nPersuader: Well that is your decision, but a couple of quarters could make a big difference to a child. What if you were in the same situation?\n\tPersuadee: I understand the point but I'd rather donate locally\nPersuader: You could think of donating even a quarter as a good bit of karma.\n\tPersuadee: I guess but I need every penny I make on mTurk. \nPersuader: Well you can be part of the solution and help these children, but if you need to small amount I will not hold it against you.\n\tPersuadee: I am going to keep the money.  Sorry.  I wouldn't expect anyone working on mTurk to give away these hard earned pennies.  If they are looking for people to be a part of the solution they should find people with money to burn\nPersuader: You should feel lucky to have what you have, I am sure you are very well of compared to those children who have nothing. There is nothing that might change your mind?\n\tPersuadee: I may say yes just to reach the end of this HIT lol.  50 minutes for 2 bucks...sheesh\nPersuader: I would like to get this wrapped up also, I just want you to know that your donation will really go to the charity.\n\tPersuadee: Sorry, but I have no reason to believe that so I am not going to donate\nPersuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment.

Are you going to donate?\nPersuader: I try to donate monthly. I will donate again this month. I think of how just a cup of coffee can pay for a meal for a family in another country like Maria.\n\tPersuadee: That is powerful. A little goes a long way for people in need. We may  not think much about a couple of bucks but to other people that can mean food for a day or two.\nPersuader: You're not donating just to the child but the family and helping them all.\n\tPersuadee: I think I could donate 25 cents. Will that be enough to help in some aspect? What is a general rule of thumb when making donations?\nPersuader: Ten cents is good. Twenty cents is better. 25 cents is better. But fifty cents can really help.\n\tPersuadee: I think I will stick with 25 cents. I usually try to stay consistent when making a effort to help others.\nPersuader: How about thirty cents?\n\tPersuadee: Ok. I can do 30 cents. I like to help other people less fortunate than me.\nPersuader: Do you think you can donate again next year too?\n\tPersuadee: Maybe. I am always open minded to helping other humans in need.

Can I start out by asking if there are any charitable causes that you feel specifically drawn to?\n\tPersuadee: I  am very interested in breast cancer and raising funds for that \nPersuader: Thank you, that is definitely a worthy cause. I wanted to get a feel for whether your interests tended to be focused on people, environment, etc. and I'm glad to hear that you are concerned for people's well-being. Unfortunately the donation I want to bring up isn't directly related to illness, but it is related to the health and livelihood of people. Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: It souns vaguely familiar does it help children in this country\nPersuader: one of the beautiful things about it is that it helps children in the US AND around the world. (I myself sometimes get a bit discouraged or feel like my personal donations don't mean as much if its reach is too localized. Especially when it's something as important as helping and in many cases rescuing children from violent areas or from malnutrition/disease. Thousands of children die every day due to circumstances that are completely outside of their control and this organization actually helps to provide them with stability which eventually will better our global future.\n\tPersuadee: that sounds like something I wuld be interested in.\nPersuader: Awesome! I'm happy to hear it. At the end of the day kids are particularly vulnerable so this organization's mission is one that I feel really strongly about.  URL here is their website if you'd like to check out accreditation before my next topic which is how this HIT lets us help. Let me know when you've looked at it :)\n\tPersuadee: let donate $1\nPersuader: Yeah! I was just about to say we can choose to donate anywhere from 0 to $2. At the end of the day, what we're really donating is our time (the minutes that it's taken to do this HIT). I don't want either of us to have to forego earning anything for our time, but I think $1 is great\n\tPersuadee: I have children and my son was very ill at one point so anything that helps children I am very interested in.  I checked ou the website and I feel like it is something I can get behind\nPersuader: I understand completely and I hope your son is doing better and continues to stay healthy! From what I'm seeing, the donation gets deducted from the task payment and even though it seems like a small donation (in the grand scheme of things) they put 90% of donations to direct aid so every dollar really adds up\n\tPersuadee: Yes he is doing better thank you for saying.  Yes every dollar adds up.  I think it is a worthy cause\nPersuader: Great! I'm glad to have been matched with a generous person :)\n\tPersuadee: I agree great minds think alike\nPersuader: Yes! And if this HIT keeps the same charity for all of the workers, then I think it's great that it's getting visibility too\n\tPersuadee: I didn;t even think aout it like that but you are right.  I think if we could all just donate a tiny bit of our income it would help everybody\nPersuader: That's a great idea. I would too even if it's a small percentage. This is on a similar topic but not directly related, but just in case you shop on Amazon and didn't know-- if you shop through smile.amazon.com you can actually choose a charity that gets a portion of donations on the money you spent. Doesn't cost you extra, I'm sure there are ones devoted to breast cancer!\n\tPersuadee: wow I didn't know at all.  Is that an app or a direct website?\nPersuader: just the direct website! I think it should be the default honestly. your login and everything is the same and you can change the charity it goes to whenever you'd like :)\n\tPersuadee: awesome I am going to definitely use them I am spending money anyway why not  donate as well.  It is a win win\nPersuader: yes! exactly. I'm buying the same things and use amazon all the time, so it makes me feel a little like I'm helping at the same time.

I work fulltime as well. If you don't mind me asking, how were you injured? \nPersuader: I fell 50 feet and broke my wrist, toe, thumb, sternium, ribs, heel. I was climbing a mountain and had to do a mountain rescue. \n\tPersuadee: Oh my goodness. That is very intense amount of injuries. Wow, mountain rescue? That sounds pretty exciting, also dangerous. How long had you been doing rescue?\nPersuader: Sorry for the delay in responses. It's hard to type. About a year. I enjoy volunteering my time and services with my skills.

The amount of injuries you sustained, I can't even believe you can type at all. That is really amazing. I like to volunteer my time (when I have it) at day shelters in Baltimore.\nPersuader: Thanks. I'm happy not to be dead or paralyzed. What kind of shelters? Animal, children, homeless? \n\tPersuadee: I imagine surviving an injury does put life into perspective. Oh, I forgot to mention. Homeless day shelters for humans.\nPersuader: Oh nice. I've helped with the climbing out of homelessness programs up here in Seattle. The shelters take homeless and addicts and put them through a program to climb mt rainier. It's all through donations. A lot of people are down on their luck, but there's also a lot of mental issues and addicts. It's quite sad, so I applaud you for helping.

I also didn't know mturk funds could be donated to a children's foundation. That is pretty nice.\nPersuader: Yeah, I try and donate a partial bit of my earnings. Even though I'm down on my luck I still have a roof over my head and food in the fridge. This organization helps with health, housing, and education for children.

It won't be alot right at this moment, but it will still be a donation.\nPersuader: Sorry to hear that for you too. I feel it's better than nothing, so I try to donate a little. How much would you like to donate? Your donation would be directly deducted from this task. You can do anywhere between $0 and $2.\n\tPersuadee: I would like to donate 0.05 today.
