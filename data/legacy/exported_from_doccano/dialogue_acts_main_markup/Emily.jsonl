Sounds like good meaningful work for a good cause.\nPersuader: It's so meaningful! Right now we are preparing a large shipment of supplies for Puerto Rico. There are families that we are in close contact with who have lost their children in the hurricane. More and more families are coming out of the woodwork, and we are becoming short on funds to help them. All I am asking is for the possibility of you to make a kind donation of two dollars so that we can ship more supplies to devastated families in Puerto Rico\n\tPersuadee: I do feel sorry for the american citizens in Puerto Rico that have been ignored by our government. I want to help, but I would rather just donate 1 dollar because to be frank I don't know much about the Save the Children organization. \nPersuader: We would really appreciate that. Right now, we are an international organization that has helped over 250,000 children in developing countries. We are based in the United States, and all of the people who participate in this organization have a background involving children (mainly teachers and parents). With donations, we are projected to help over 750,000 children in the next three years.\n\tPersuadee: I'll donate 1 dollar. Seems like a good organization that helps people in need. \nPersuader: I'm sorry, my computer kind of glitched out. How much would you like to donate to the organization now?

You are helping us give a wonderful service.\n\tPersuadee: no problem. It's not much by myself, but I hope a lot of people pitching together makes a difference\nPersuader: Exactly. It's surprising how $100 can go so far within this organization.\n\tPersuadee: I'm disappointed that the government isn't helping puerto rico like it did with katrina or any other disaster\nPersuader: I completely understand, especially because they are our territory.

And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.  Including an \"A\" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.  \n\tPersuadee: That's awesome! Do you know when the charity began?\nPersuader: It was founded way back on April 15, 1919! A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.  Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!\n\tPersuadee: That is very impressive. Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?\nPersuader: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.\n\tPersuadee: That is awesome.\nPersuader: I know I was surprised by those numbers.  A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.\nPersuader: That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.\n\tPersuadee: That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.\nPersuader: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\n\tPersuadee: Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.\nPersuader: Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.\nPersuader: That is so special.  That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.  How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?  You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.  You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.  I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.\n\tPersuadee: Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is awesome!

Is that the organization that provides food for kids around the world?\nPersuader: Correct, With a primary focus on those in troubled nations (such as war zones or poorly developed nations). If you would like to help, a donation from you could help save the thousands of children that deal with violence and hunger as a daily part of their lives.\n\tPersuadee: Do you provide other things besides food?\nPersuader: Of course, one of our focus points is to provide health care, education, and safety to these children to help give them a way out of their troubled lives. And your small donation can go a long way, something as small as the price of a candy bar can be the difference in these kids lives.\n\tPersuadee: Oh wow, that's a lot. what percent of my donation goes directly to the kids?\nPersuader: In 2017 86% of all fund raise went directly to the children in need, and of the 86%, 34% was directly put into providing food and nutrition.\n\tPersuadee: And the other percent that didn't go to food went to what? \nPersuader: Education, Emergency Relief, HIV/Aids treatment, and helping the children stay in a safe environment. I know its easy to ignore these children because they are half way around the world, but they need your help. Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable and treatable causes. Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of children and a lifetime of poor health. All it takes is an easy donation from you to help these children\n\tPersuadee: Which countries are being helped right now? \nPersuader: Much of the focus right now goes to war torn countries like Syria, but your donation would also go to help those who were hurt by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Maria in the Gulf of Mexico \n\tPersuadee: Texas, that's interesting. A lot of people lost homes and belongings in Harvey. It would be nice to help them.\nPersuader: So, How much do you like to donate to the charity now?\n\tPersuadee: I don't have a lot to give\nPersuader: Thats okay, a donation as little as 77 cents can house a refugee family for a day.\n\tPersuadee: OK 77 cents sounds good\nPersuader: Awesome, The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: great, I'm glad to help.", "label": [[11, 34, "Conventional-Opening"], [78, 235, "Statement"], [339, 446, "Affirmative-Answer"], [1280, 1381, "Statement"], [1657, 1721, "Statement"], [2228, 2310, "Statement"], [447, 602, "Statement"], [668, 823, "Statement"], [668, 823, "Affirmative-Answer"], [823, 955, "Statement"], [1056, 1196, "Statement"], [1056, 1196, "Other-Answer"], [1280, 1381, "Other-Answer"], [1382, 1492, "Statement"], [1492, 1656, "Statement"], [1790, 1988, "Statement"], [1790, 1988, "Other-Answer"], [2123, 2177, "WH-Question"], [2358, 2445, "Statement"]], "idx": 779}

I was going to make a plea and ask if you would be willing to donate to Save the Children. It helps kids in need. I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help. Can you donate part of today's pay? Even a bit?\n\tPersuadee: It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.  So I would definitely be willing to help.  \nPersuader: Yes, I agree, it is sad. That is great that you can help! How much of today's pay can you give? Also, please include the $ sign with your pledge. Thank you!\n\tPersuadee: I think the bonus of today is 2 dollars so maybe if we both give half of it?  That is at least something.  I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.  What do you think? \nPersuader: I would love to help as well. Can you pledge with the $ sign in your next reply.

I could not imagine having to watch any child suffer, much less my own. Have you visited the Save the Children website?\n\tPersuadee: I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.  I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.  It really upsets me \nPersuader: I looked at the site. Have you heard about the recent storms/flooding in Hawaii?\n\tPersuadee: A little bit but not much.  I have been following politics and things are going crazy.  I am hoping that things will change soon. \nPersuader: Well, it looks like the STC is already to help the children there. I am amazed by their swift response. Isn't it really great!\n\tPersuadee: That is great that they are there helping.  Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.  The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping. \nPersuader: Yes, I am sure that is it. I have to thank you again for your $1 donation. It will go to great use I am sure. Do you have any questions about the charity?\n\tPersuadee: Not really.

I'm very particular about who I donate to so I'd need more information\nPersuader: Understand.   \n\tPersuadee: About how many people a month does the charity help?\nPersuader: Since it is international it helps more then 1000's of kids per month.\n\tPersuadee: And is there a minimum amount required per month (like on of those sponsor a kid charities) or can it be just a one time donation?\nPersuader: No minimum, can be a one time donation.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds doable. Do you know by any chance if this is a registered charity? I want to make sure not all the money is going to the staff via salaries\nPersuader: Its non-governmental but is register to for tax purposes.   Only about 25% goes to the management/staff of the charity.\n\tPersuadee: Okay, that's good to know. I'll make a $20 donation today and keep researching this charity. If it checks out like you say, then I'll consider upping any future donations\nPersuader: This is great.  Thank you for your donation. \n\tPersuadee: No problem.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?\nPersuader: Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need\n\tPersuadee: The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. Children should be our top priority all across the world. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?\nPersuader: Oh there are quiet a few ways. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.\n\tPersuadee: I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Could I pledge $1/day to start with?\nPersuader: absolutely thank you so much!!\n\tPersuadee: I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!\nPersuader: Absolutely. I love getting the word out there on this charity. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. Children should be a priority in the world. They are our future.\n\tPersuadee: They are our future exactly. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. How long have you been supporting this charity?\nPersuader: I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?\n\tPersuadee: I would like to start making a difference today. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.\nPersuader: Thank you! That makes my heart so happy. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.\n\tPersuadee: I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. It hurts my heart. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.\nPersuader: Every penny counts!!\n\tPersuadee: Well that sounds just great to me!\nPersuader: Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!\n\tPersuadee: You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

Is there a request process, or is it distributed based on current events (natural disaster, civil unrest)?\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it to the Save the Children fund where it will be distributed based on a request process.

There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that\n\tPersuadee: So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?\nPersuader: Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  \n\tPersuadee: I feel so silly! Is \"Save the Children\" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching\nPersuader: Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.\n\tPersuadee: Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough\nPersuader: Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.\n\tPersuadee: Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?\nPersuader:  URL here you go\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?\nPersuader: I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club\n\tPersuadee: oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.\nPersuader: Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.\nPersuader: I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. \n\tPersuadee: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me, I will definitely look more into this charity!\nPersuader: Great happy to help!

I have donated before.\nPersuader: Would you like to donate again?\n\tPersuadee: Not sure why?\nPersuader: Children like Maria can use your help. She is one of ten children. They need all the help they can get. They live in a war zone.\n\tPersuadee: Oh that is horrible. I think I might donate. I think any amount of money will help. Are you going to donate?\nPersuader: I try to donate monthly. I will donate again this month. I think of how just a cup of coffee can pay for a meal for a family in another country like Maria.\n\tPersuadee: That is powerful. A little goes a long way for people in need. We may  not think much about a couple of bucks but to other people that can mean food for a day or two.\nPersuader: You're not donating just to the child but the family and helping them all.\n\tPersuadee: I think I could donate 25 cents. Will that be enough to help in some aspect? What is a general rule of thumb when making donations?\nPersuader: Ten cents is good. Twenty cents is better. 25 cents is better. But fifty cents can really help.\n\tPersuadee: I think I will stick with 25 cents. I usually try to stay consistent when making a effort to help others.\nPersuader: How about thirty cents?\n\tPersuadee: Ok. I can do 30 cents. I like to help other people less fortunate than me.\nPersuader: Do you think you can donate again next year too?\n\tPersuadee: Maybe. I am always open minded to helping other humans in need. I will probably donate late this year as well.\nPersuader: Ok. So 30 cents is your final donation for today?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I would like to donate 30 cents.

How about yourself?\nPersuader: I am doing well thank you and same here\n\tPersuadee: Awesome. What are some of your hobbies?\nPersuader: Well one hobby is volunteering. I wanted to talk to you about a charity Save the Children, have you heard of it?\n\tPersuadee: Only in name. I haven't heard too much about it though. Can you tell me more?\nPersuader: It is a charity that helps ensure children's rights to healthcare, education, safety, etc. all over the world \n\tPersuadee: What do you do as a volunteer for this charity?\nPersuader: Well I volunteer for another nonprofit organization, but I guess I am a volunteer in a way trying to encourage people to donate money. even a few cents can add up!\n\tPersuadee: Hmm, I see. Do you have information about their charity rating? How much of the donation will actually be used to help the children?\nPersuader: The research team will collect all the donations and send it to Save the Children. It is a trustworthy organizaition that will use your donation to the fullest \n\tPersuadee: I always like to see some report first. Maybe I will have to do some research first. Have you donated to them yourself?\nPersuader: You can find more information at their website,  URL  I actually have not yet.\n\tPersuadee: How did you come to find out about this charity?\nPersuader: This conversation actually, but any charity that helps children is alright in my book\n\tPersuadee: You never know though. I've heard of poorly run charities that misuse the donations. Like only 50% of your donation actually helps children. You gotta make sure your donation is helping the needy.\nPersuader: you are very right, and I wish I could give you more solid proof, but I do not hae it\n\tPersuadee: What is the other nonprofit that you support?\nPersuader: A local one that helps children with trauma and hx of sexual abuse\n\tPersuadee: That's nice of you.
