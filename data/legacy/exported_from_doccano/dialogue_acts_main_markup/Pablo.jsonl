It's easy to donate when you feel attached to the situation, but helping someone you don't know takes a really special kind of person.\n\tPersuadee: yes, plus your making a difference in other peoples lives or animals. it is gods work.\nPersuader: I agree! Have you ever volunteered your time for a charity?\n\tPersuadee: I have made donations to the charity, but I have never volunteered for one.\nPersuader: We're all so busy or sometimes it's hard to get out to help so donating is a really good way to be able to help. Based on my understanding of Save the Children, it's an organization that is really important in this present time. In 2018 many children are affected by wars (for example Syria). \n\tPersuadee: yes, I heard they are a good organization and are willing to help as much children as positive. is 0.30 cents a good donation to give?\nPersuader: Anything you could donate would be amazing, from .01 to the full $2.

Do you think you could give a little more?\n\tPersuadee: i was thinking 0.30 as the amount I want to give. but I could up to to 0.50 cents\nPersuader: That's great.

You are helping us give a wonderful service.\n\tPersuadee: no problem. It's not much by myself, but I hope a lot of people pitching together makes a difference\nPersuader: Exactly. It's surprising how $100 can go so far within this organization.\n\tPersuadee: I'm disappointed that the government isn't helping puerto rico like it did with katrina or any other disaster\nPersuader: I completely understand, especially because they are our territory. That's why organizations have stepped up and taking the place of the government. We are so desperately in need of money though, so we sincerely  thank you.\n\tPersuadee: You're welcome!

You?\n\tPersuadee: Similiar, I only donate when I have the money to spare.\nPersuader: You can help now! You can donate any amount from your task payment to Save the Children now if you'd like. \n\tPersuadee: I'm not sure if I want to, but I can give a little.\nPersuader: How much would you like to give? The research team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: I'll give 5 cents.\nPersuader: I'll do the same. \n\tPersuadee: Great, I'm glad we're helping a little.\nPersuader: I imagine a lot of people end up doing these hits. It probably adds up, assuming everyone pitches in a little. \n\tPersuadee: Agreed, which is probably what they want.\nPersuader: I'd assume so.

{"id": 3399, "data": "Persuader: Have you heard of the charity Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I have, but I don't know a lot about it.\nPersuader: They promote children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a very nice cause.\nPersuader: Yes, it\\'s a great cause.  And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.  Including an \"A\" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.  \n\tPersuadee: That's awesome! Do you know when the charity began?\nPersuader: It was founded way back on April 15, 1919! A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.  Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!\n\tPersuadee: That is very impressive. Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?\nPersuader: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.\n\tPersuadee: That is awesome.\nPersuader: I know I was surprised by those numbers.  A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.\nPersuader: That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.\n\tPersuadee: That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.\nPersuader: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\n\tPersuadee: Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.\nPersuader: Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.\nPersuader: That is so special.  That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.  How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?  You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.  You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.  I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.\n\tPersuadee: Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is awesome!  Nice move.  That's some good karma for you right there, and knowledge that your money is going to help children around the world.

We just love that they're so transparent with their spending and they give us concrete examples of why our past donations have helped them.\n\tPersuadee: could you name a couple of examples please?\nPersuader: Well, the examples they provided were specifically showing us what parts of their charity the money was going towards, and what those parts did. Essentially a lot of it was relief for the poor, in the form of shelter, clothing and food.\n\tPersuadee: Glad to see it goes to shelter, clothing, and food.

Small amounts actually do go far. A couple bucks and it's a few meals for someone. It's mind blowing.\n\tPersuadee: sound good. You do make a point. I am interested to help.\nPersuader: Thanks! Then definitely donate the full two. You'll be really happy you did, trust me.\n\tPersuadee: I trust you.
