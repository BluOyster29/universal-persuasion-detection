{"id": 3387, "data": "Persuader: Hello! Have you ever donated to a charity before?\n\tPersuadee: Hi, Yes, I have donated to the ASPCA\nPersuader: I have too! I love dogs. What about Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I have never donated to Save the Children, but I would be willing to do so. I love to help children also.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a great organization. Would you be willing to donate some of your earnings from this task toward that charity?\n\tPersuadee: yes, I would be willing to donate a portion of my earnings to the charity.\nPersuader: That's so generous! It's easy to donate when you feel attached to the situation, but helping someone you don't know takes a really special kind of person.\n\tPersuadee: yes, plus your making a difference in other peoples lives or animals. it is gods work.\nPersuader: I agree! Have you ever volunteered your time for a charity?\n\tPersuadee: I have made donations to the charity, but I have never volunteered for one.\nPersuader: We're all so busy or sometimes it's hard to get out to help so donating is a really good way to be able to help. Based on my understanding of Save the Children, it's an organization that is really important in this present time. In 2018 many children are affected by wars (for example Syria). \n\tPersuadee: yes, I heard they are a good organization and are willing to help as much children as positive. is 0.30 cents a good donation to give?\nPersuader: Anything you could donate would be amazing, from .01 to the full $2. Even a small donation helps multiple children. Do you think you could give a little more?\n\tPersuadee: i was thinking 0.30 as the amount I want to give. but I could up to to 0.50 cents\nPersuader: That's great. I think about the amount of money I spend on buying cup of coffee these days, I could definitely go without one in order to help some kids!\n\tPersuadee: yeah same here. every bit is appreciated.\nPersuader: Maybe we can each encourage someone else in our lives to make a donation, and spread the impact. Do you feel like you're willing to donate that .50 cents?\n\tPersuadee: yes I will donate 50 cents\nPersuader: That's amazing. Thanks so much for being so kind and open-minded today.  I've enjoyed talking to you and hope you have a great day!\n\tPersuadee: thank you and you too", "label": [[11, 60, "Conventional-Opening"]], "idx": 10}
