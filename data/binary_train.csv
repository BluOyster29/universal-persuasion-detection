okay.... i think this is about children's charity,1
Small amounts here and there in stores.,1
"It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental/animal rights thing.",1
You can donate anything from as little as 0.10 and since it is money you don't have yet since you have not been paid for the task it isn't like it is coming out of your pocket.,1
Are you a parent?,1
I think it is amazing charity to give to and really hits home with having children myself.,1
that would be great.,1
Some others are not so fortunate though :(,1
would you like to donate $1 today,1
A dollar might be chocolate bar or a soda to you but to the people we help its worth so much more.,1
Oh! That is great. Thank you very much.,1
thank you so much.,0
Many people spend unnecessary money on snacks or candy every single day.,1
Great! You should do it.,1
"I do, among others, most of which involve children.",1
Excellent!,1
"Please consider donating at least a small portion of your earnings from this task to a children\'s charity called ""Save the Children"". ",0
eed,1
they now are helping Hawaii with the hurricane.,1
Think about all the children in war torn areas and all of the physical and emotional support they need.,1
"Sure, Save the Children is an international non-government organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.",1
"I know a bit about them, I have donated to them in the past actually.  ",1
They also have their annual financial report actually listed on their website which I think is pretty impressive for a charity organization.,1
 do you like to donate?,1
"But if you think about the children that would be helped, they have nothing. ",1
You can donate any portion of your payment for this task or HIT or whatever you'd call it! Think of it as your quick little helping hand.,1
That's a beautiful place.,1
Are you willing to make a small donation between fifty cents to two dollars that you would gain from this task to go toward this Charity?,1
You can donate any portion of your payment from $.01 to $2!,1
I am representing the charity and I am hoping that you will consider donating directly from your task payment. ,1
ake,1
I donate children charity.,1
I want to tell you a little about a charity called Save the Children.,1
d,0
" Hello, have you heard of the organization Save the Children?",1
"ok, I will get it out to as soon as possible!",1
The world needs more people who love to help the less fortunate.,1
Interesting.,1
Hi.,1
"YES, I DONATE 20 DOLLAR TO THE CHILDREN ITS VERY HELP TO THEM.",1
Nice. ,1
Oh so you know all about helping already.,1
Seems like there a lot of children in need.,1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"Well, since you are earning money from this hit, you would be able to donate any or all of it. ",1
ohh that is really sad to hear.,1
" yea, that's correct!",1
happy tuesday!,1
Can I ask you a question?,1
"i see, well any charity donation from my view is of great need, although i feel save the children are in more need than an animal shelter in terms of the money they need to make an impact.",1
You can donate some of your earnings to this amazing charity.,1
 That would be both cool and frightening at the same time. ,1
"Wow, that is very thoughtful of you. You go the extra mile for that child and I know he appreciates everything that you do for him.",1
I used to work with kids with special needs.,1
"I really appreciate your sympathizing,",1
It's surprising how much less these children have.,1
Have you ever heard of a charity called Save the Children?,1
I've done a little more lately.,1
I know,1
Can you donate part of today's pay?,1
You will?,1
What group?,1
Thank you for your $1 donation! Have a good evening :),1
Have you ever heard of this charity? ,1
I completely understand.,1
"Hi, how are you today?",1
And thanks for helping!,1
