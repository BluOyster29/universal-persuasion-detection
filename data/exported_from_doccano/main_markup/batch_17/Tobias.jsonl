Yes, I am familiar with Save the Children.\nPersuader: Well today, we are asking MTurk workers to donate a portion or all of their earnings connected with this HIT to Save the CHildren. It is an easy way to support a very good cause.\n\tPersuadee: Okay. Sounds like a good way to raise some money.\nPersuader: As yo u are probably aware, the charity has a very good track record of getting donations to the supported projects and has a very low overhead cost structure.\n\tPersuadee: Yes - I have donated to this charity before in the past.\nPersuader: That is great and thank you for your past support! How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I don't think I will donate anything today.\nPersuader: If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason for your decision? \n\tPersuadee: I donate to the charity twice a year already and today I would like to keep my full bonus.\nPersuader: I completely understand and appreciate your past support. I would also like you to think about how your MTurk bonus could be put to good use in places like Syria and Myanmar where there are on going tragedies. You could do a lot of good with the additional donation today.\n\tPersuadee: Yes I understand that these are important causes that need donations.\nPersuader: Think of it as giving up a cup of coffee today. I am not sure where you live, but I am in New York and you would be hard pressed to get a cup of coffee for $2. That money could really be used to help children in terrible situations and make their lives slightly better.\n\tPersuadee: Yes - I am sure that $2 dollars would be able to accomplish a lot more through Save the Children.\nPersuader: Not only that, but think about it in the bigger picture. When all MTurk workers contribute their bonus payment today, it adds up to a lot of money very quickly. While you may think your $2 is not that much, when it is put together with all the other generous donations from MTurk workers, it really adds up quickly.\n\tPersuadee: I didn't think about it like that. This is something to consider. It would be a nice-sized donation.\nPersuader: It really would. Your $2 along with everyone else's can make a big difference in the lives of other people. Would you reconsider your earlier decision?\n\tPersuadee: I don't think that I will donate anything today, sorry.\nPersuader: Can I ask what you will be using your $2 for than? It seems like such a small amount that it should be easy to make the donation and not have it impact you greatly.\n\tPersuadee: It will be put into savings along with my other mturk money.\nPersuader: Well I can understand your position even though I think it is selfish.

Through the power of child sponsorship, you can help a child in need realize her dreams ¡ª transforming her life and the future we all share. Sponsor a child today!

We know from our nearly 100 years of service that family separation and detention can cause severe, long-lasting trauma, which ultimately results in the loss of childhood.\n\tPersuadee: thats horrible, how many children are they helping the u.s \nPersuader: Thanks to the generosity of donors like you, we help the nation's most vulnerable children become ready for kindergarten _ and excel by third grade _ so they can succeed in school and in life. Plus our teams are there before, during and after emergencies _ preparing children, protecting them and helping them cope in the aftermath.  Save the Children is a leading advocate for children, ensuring their voices are heard and their best interests are prioritized. We fill critical gaps in services and deliver scalable solutions to the challenges children face.\n\tPersuadee: Do they only support children in the U.S>\nPersuader: No, we support children all over the world. Children may only be 20% of our population, but they are 100% of our future. That's why advocacy is core to Save the Children's work on behalf of all kids across the United States. We're building bipartisan support at the local, state and federal level to make sure every child in the U.S. has access to high-quality learning opportunities, and much more.\n\tPersuadee: That is wonderful to hear. I am glad to hear more about this organization. I wish I could help.\nPersuader: All across the globe, children are dying from preventable causes, missing out on education due to poverty or gender, suffering from violence, exploitation and neglect, and are vulnerable in times of crisis.

Any idea if that is a real charity?\n\tPersuadee: It sounds familiar, but I'm not a hundred percent sure if it is a legit charity. \nPersuader: Are you planning to donate part of your earnings to them?\n\tPersuadee: No. I can't afford to give part of my earnings to charity. \nPersuader: I know the feeling.  I'm on food stamps myself.  Rather feed my children than some radom ones.\n\tPersuadee: I have a sister and brother who are struggling and I often give them money. That is why I'm working on turks.

I am doing well, just trying to talk to see if you would like to donate to Save the Children. It is an international organization that helps children in developing countries. \n\tPersuadee: Have you donated to the charity?\nPersuader: Not yet, it is something I am interested in doing though. Education is something that is really important to me and that is something that they help with. I think every child should have access to edcuation, especially in developing countries so that they can help improve their living situations. \n\tPersuadee: Yes, I agree, did you grow up with the proper resources?\nPersuader: I went through the public education system, it was one of the better school districts at the time. What about you? Is a lack of education something you faced?\n\tPersuadee: I went to private Catholic school until I was 13, then I went to Public schools which was a much better experience\nPersuader: So you were able to have a good education experience as well. Isn't that something you would like to help other children receive? Anything from $0.01 to $2.00 or any amount you choose, it can go to helping them get an education. \n\tPersuadee: Why is this charity worthy of my money?\nPersuader: Think about how often you buy a pack of gum or a candy bar, something you don't really need but it is because you want it. You can just skip that next impulse purchase to help out. Save the Children does help more than education as well. They help ensure children's access to health care (which we know is a huge topic of discussion every where),and help improve their safety and well being. Many kids do not have access to safe living conditions to even make it to school each day. \n\tPersuadee: I usually donate to animal shelters,where do you donate ?\nPersuader: What ever charity my grocery store is supporting at the time. Typically children related, sometimes it is for others.

What do you believe the value of charity is to you? \n\tPersuadee: It depends on what I am giving to. Am I giving to an organization or straight to another fellow human.\nPersuader: I would argue that the recipient is not relevant. You see, in my opinion, Charity in and of itself is a selfish act. Or perhaps, a better way to say it is that it is more of an exchange. We exchange our time, energy, money etc for a powerful thing. That thing is called purpose. \n\tPersuadee: Oh!! That really opened me up. I've never thought of it that way. But that goes against the literal definition of charity, no?\nPersuader: Perhaps, but does the definition matter to those who are in need? \n\tPersuadee: Not at all. Those in need don't mind where help comes from. But I tend to question some charity organizations. What's your view on these organizations/ foundations?\nPersuader: Well, I have one in mind specifically. It's called Save The Children. They seem pretty fantastic. Theyve single handedly reduced the infant mortality rate by 62% in third world countries. Can I verify that? Of course not. But I believe it. And thats what matters to me. I believe that the little I have to give could help, and because of that it makes me feel delightful. I'm doing my best with what I've got. Are you?\n\tPersuadee: You know what they say...\"charity begins at home\". So I make sure my home is helped before I help others.\nPersuader: Of course! As you should. I believe your heart it good, I can tell just from talking to you anonymously. But I also believe that there is more of you to share with the world.

How are you?\nPersuader: Very good.  We were looking to have a cookout, but it's raining, so I have a bit of time for some mturk work.\n\tPersuadee: Oh. I am sorry about that. I hope it clears up soon. It's been raining here as well. So, is there anything specific we are supposed to be discussing here or just chatting about life? \nPersuader: Yes, I have been asked to solicit a donation to the Save the Children charity.\n\tPersuadee: Oh I see. I'm the donator and you're the solicitor. So, what is the Save the Children charity? \nPersuader: It's been around almost forever.  Save the Children supports nutrition, sanitation and education initiatives in the US and third world countries.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds pretty good. I don't know why I've never heard of it. Doesn't sound like a charity someone could disagree with. Have they had any scandals or any thing? \nPersuader: None that I am aware of.  I'm surprised you've never heard of it.  They have run television commercials off and on for decades.\n\tPersuadee: Only thing that comes to mind is UNICEF. It also has kind of a generic name, but I suppose if it's been around so long, then others copied those sorts of names from them. But that could be why it isn't strong in my memory. \nPersuader: Less than 10% of the money raised goes for fund raising purposes, and only 5% for management.  Over 85% goes directly to recipients.  It is one of the most efficient charities around and is highly rated by the groups that do such things.\n\tPersuadee: Awesome. Well then, I guess I would like to donate. How does that work? \nPersuader: You can donate the money that you are receiving for this mturk task, up to $2.  It's for a good cause.\n\tPersuadee: Ahhhh. I see. Ok that wasn\\'t clear to me in my instructions. Alright. So, do I just say something specific like \"I would like to donate 2 dollars\" or do you have to ask me a specific question?\nPersuader: I suspect that end of the conversation, you will be asked to donate a specific amount.  But it can't hurt to state how much of it you would like to donate.  With me, there's something about holiday weekends that makes me feel more charitable.\n\tPersuadee: Ok. I am going to donate the entire $2 then. Are you provided with any sort of incentive to make me donate more? The donation will stay the same regardless. Or are you not allowed to say?\nPersuader: What I know is that the research team will collect all the money all the donations and send the money directly to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: I feel like that is a statement they told you to say if someone asks haha. That's fine. Like I said. I will keep the donation the same, I just was curious. I am I the only person you've had to ask? \nPersuader: Yes, you are.  Sometimes it's hard to figure out what some of these mturk tasks are going after.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah. I am wondering if they will still give me the $2 regardless, but I am not holding hope. It's okay regardless. If it's as good of an organization as it seems, then I don't mind. \nPersuader: The task indicates that we can complete the conversation now.  Thank you for the donation.

I hope that you are having a great day so far!\n\tPersuadee: good morning, yes i am... i hope you are as well\nPersuader: Indeed I am :) would it be alright with you if I spoke to you a little bit about a wonderful charity called Save The Children?\n\tPersuadee: Absolutely, I am a little familiar with that orginization....\nPersuader: Thats great! Save The Children is a charity program that helps millions of children across the world. We provide numerous support groups and programs to help children everywhere. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. We provide protection to children and emotional support to them.\n\tPersuadee: wow.... My career is working with the homeless... i am thankful that we dont have to factor protection from real bodily harm into our work. Save the Children truly is a good cause\nPersuader: That is amazing :) I have several friends and family that work together in my area to provide support for children and women against domestic violence. And to be able to speak to someone about the Save The Children Foundation is an honor. Across the US one in five children grows up in poverty. We have been around since 1932, providing support to the most isolated and under-served children in Rural America. The best program we offer in my opinion is Education and our programs to help children grieve and obtain the emotional support they need in order to grow.\n\tPersuadee: So Save The Children is 86 years old... that's incredible... a tremendous ammount of good has been done in all those years.... just out of curiosity, what is the percentage of donations that actually get to the need? i mean how much of every dollar is used for the actual program?\nPersuader: Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. I am more than happy to provide information about our cause. 86% of our funding goes to  Program Services, 9% goes into fundraising meaning we get the word out about the charity and set up events. And just 5% goes to management and general things. Here is a link that breaks down all our costs and the donations we receive.  URL s/about-us/financial-information\n\tPersuadee: Please dont misunderstand... i think you are a little low though.... i think more like 88.3% goes to your programs which is an incredibly great amount by comparison... like i said, I also work in Charity so its very interesting to me\nPersuader: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: PERSON_1: Our 86% was based off our 2017 annual report, I am sure there could be even more of a percentage as of late. Around 34% of donations go to health and nutrition, and my personal favorite is 21% into education benefits. I believe if we are able to give people a proper education they can learn so much and see that anything is possible in our world. That the world is not always cruel and that you can pull yourself from the ground up to the sky if you really want to. \n\tPersuadee: I Completely agree.... and after all... we have to take care of our children because they are our future\nPersuader: I would like to apologize for my mistype in the previous message. It seems as if my wording went over and it caused some issues for the system. I completely agree with you as well. If we do not help our children then there will be no future. Every childs life matters, and where we are not forced to help those that need it, a lot of people still find the compassion to see that even a little amount of money can go a long way in helping those around us less fortunate.\n\tPersuadee: you are absolutely correct... if a lot of people donate a little.... its still an astounding amount\nPersuader: So based off our discussion would you be interested in donating to the charity now? Your donation would be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment.\n\tPersuadee: I do not have a problem with that at all, as a matter of fact... i've been waiting for you to ask... hahaha\nPersuader: Thats great! I would much rather give someone facts and accurate/detailed information about a cause or charity before asking for anything from said person. So that depending on what you like and what you hear you can make the decision yourself on what you feel would be a good donation. For I cannot decide how much you donate to the cause, but rather what I myself can donate. Do you have a figure in mind?\n\tPersuadee: I do, I was thinking Half of my payment which would be a total donation of $1\nPersuader: Thank you so much! Your donation means the world, and is very generous of you.\n\tPersuadee: Honestly it is a blessing to me to be able to help even in such a small way", "label": [[25, 71, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [159, 270, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [159, 270, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [356, 368, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [458, 534, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [458, 534, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [535, 627, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [628, 741, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [742, 806, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1162, 1248, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1249, 1304, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1305, 1419, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1420, 1574, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1420, 1574, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1879, 1922, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [144, 158, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [369, 457, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [369, 458, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [742, 806, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1010, 1028, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1028, 1162, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1305, 1419, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1305, 1419, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1420, 1574, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1923, 1983, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2171, 2247, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2681, 2789, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2681, 2789, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2790, 2919, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2920, 3039, "3-EMOTION-OTHER"], [4112, 4254, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [4255, 4385, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [4477, 4506, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [4608, 4627, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [4627, 4686, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1984, 2119, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2572, 2680, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [2120, 2170, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [3312, 3348, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [3349, 3409, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [3410, 3637, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [3761, 3844, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [4099, 4111, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [4386, 4476, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"]], "idx": "829"}

They do this in the United States and some overseas countries where the need is tremendous.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a great charity.

Waiting for the summer heat to die down, though it's nicely dying, LOL. What part of the world are you in?\n\tPersuadee: I hear that! I'm in Georgia, USA. It's super humid today. How about you?\nPersuader: Oh wow, I used to live in Atlanta. I'm in Pennsylvania. Yesterday was humid, and I still haven't stepped outside today. Still in the AC!\n\tPersuadee: I'm originally from NYC. My friends back at home were telling me that it has been particularly hot these past few days. The temperature down here has been rather lower than usual, but the humidity is high!\nPersuader: Oh wow, I used to live in Jersey City, which is a ride away from NYC. So cool. I went to school there from nonprofit management, and ironically I'm working with a group called Save The Children. It's an org that provides basic assistance to children around the world with necessities needed to live. Ones we often take for granted in the states. We're currently seeking donations up to $2. Are you interested in giving back a bit of $$? It could do so much good in the life of a hungry, neglected, or abused child. \n\tPersuadee: I wish I could! For right now, this is my only source of income, and I have a 5 month old infant to feed. In the future, I will give back double, but for now he and I need all the help we can get.\nPersuader: Oh wow. Do you have a boy or a girl? I totally understand your position. Again, no amount is too small. One penny donated from your earnings could do a lot of good in the 3rd world. I'll match whatever you decide to give. I'm not floating in money either, but to me this is worth it. Let me know.\n\tPersuadee: A little boy, my first. I will donate $.25. During our difficult time, I can still spare some money to help another. I can only hope that will help, and maybe we will have some good karma! His dad was working, but was in a car accident and now he's still in the hospital in Jacksonville, FL recovering.\nPersuader: Well total congrats to you on new mother! And thank you so much for your donation! I will of course match that $.25. I think $.50 from the both us us can go a long way. Every little bit counts. I believe in karma as well. Is the father of your child expected to recover soon and be released. That is so terrible. For anyone, but especially a new dad. You totally have my prayers and positive energy.\n\tPersuadee: Thank you so much! I have found my calling in life and love being a mommy. I'm glad to help. Every little bit does count, and while I have downtime I do lots of online work to make a little bit of money. He will be in the hospital for the rest of September, he shattered his ankle in a car crash. He has epilepsy and had a breakthrough seizure. He is doing ok though, thank God, and thank you for your prayers and positive energy. \nPersuader: I'm glad you found your calling. I work online and do on demand jobs as well. It started out due to illness, but I really like it. I like Turking, but I also like Microworkers, TextBroker (writing), and finding gigs on Upwork.com. Are there any good online work sites you'd recommend? I'm up for any job.\n\tPersuadee: For now, I am just using Turk, but I have used other survey sites in the past. I get the best results and most consistent payments with Turking.\nPersuader: Oh so cool. When I was driving for uber last year, I drove a woman with epilepsy, who just began having seizures recently, and we were talking about remedies for her. I suggested the legal CBD oil as I began taking it for anxiety, and she said she would check it out. A lot of people have also been helped with legal marijuana, but I don't think that's available in GA. And that sucks.\n\tPersuadee: Agreed. My husband is a strong supporter of CBD oil. He is trying to get approved for a medical marijuana card, because it helps him immensely.\nPersuader: Oh wow so cool. I know funds are low, but in the future are there any causes you feel strongly about that you would put your money behind?\n\tPersuadee: Epilepsy and finding a cure, for sure.\nPersuader: Oh. Recently I've become interested in donating to people who are wrongfully incarcerated. I'd like to donate to their legal fees. Like you, I do believe in karma and goodness, but haven't really donated much. Matching your donation today makes me feel really good.\n\tPersuadee: Well I'm glad that I was able to help today, even with a small amount.\nPersuader: Thank you so much, have a great day! And I'll truly keep your family in my prayers! I know your partner will heal sooner than expected!!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you!

{"id": 3125, "data": "Persuader: Hello. I am glad you are joining me here for this important task.\n\tPersuadee: Hi Thanks\nPersuader: You're welcome. I am glad they assigned us this task because it has the potential to help children. Do you consider yourself an empathetic person normally?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I am an empathetic person because I have children myself. \nPersuader: Oh that is good! I also have children. I have three girls. You? (I won't ask for any personal details - I promise.)\n\tPersuadee: I have a son and a daughter. Both are adults now but it seems like yesterday they were younger. \nPersuader: Ahh, yes I know what you mean. My oldest will be 21 next week, and the youngers ones are in their late teenage years. It goes by so quickly!\n\tPersuadee: Yes it does! My daughter is 19 and she is still living with us. Going to school for nursing. My son is 26 and lives with us because he is autistic and non-verbal.\nPersuader: My husband has a little brother who has Asperger's. Not nearly the level of autism of your son, but I do have empathy for you. \n\tPersuadee: Oh thank you so much. Me and my husband are very grateful that he is not as severe as some. He can pretty much understand everything you are saying and he can do many things for himself like eating, bathing, washing his clothes and many other things. It's just that the speech is not there. He started at 2 yrs. but it never developed.\nPersuader: It must be very hard, and also at the same time very rewarding, taking care of a child with special needs.  It is interesting that your daughter is going to school for nursing. Do you think that it's because she has spent her life watching (and I'd assume participating in the) care of her brother?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, that is exactly what she said was the reason she got into nursing! She has been his right hand since she was born. She knows more about him than i do. :)\nPersuader: Wow! You must be very proud of her! \n\tPersuadee: Yes I am. I know you are proud of your daughters. What is your daughter going to college to do?\nPersuader: She graduated with a degree in Interior Design. She has been a designer since she was about 3 years old! LOL  My other girls, though, have no idea what they like, except that they all like taking care of children (all work in day care or nanny jobs).\n\tPersuadee: That awesome! I always admire people who can visualize what is stylish for a room. I don't know a thing about decorating! And your other two sound like very compassionate and caring young ladies. You have to be to take care of little ones!\nPersuader: I am with you there! I have absolutely zero flair for style. But my daughter has always been able to put things together so well. I honestly don't know where she got it from! But, I am happy that at least someone in the family can make us look good. Haha  And yes, they are all so good with little ones. It does make me feel good to see that. I feel like I must have done some good things right as a mom, if they like kids so much!\n\tPersuadee: Yes indeed! Some people are not as fortunate to have parents such as us. But I think that I did pretty good myself! My son did learn some living skills and learning more and my daughter is in school. \nPersuader: I am sure you have done a great job with both of your kids! It sounds like they are very special!  I didn't design it this way, but I am glad that we talked about our kids so much. Are you familiar with a charity called Save the Children? I am to ask you if you would please donate all or part of the small stipend that we make for this discussion to that charity tonight.  Would you do that?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I am familiar and I sure will. I can donate $1 if that is all right. \nPersuader: Yes, absolutely, $1 would be a lovely donation.  That will be deducted directly from your payment. Is that okay with you?\n\tPersuadee: Yes that is fine. I love to be a part of helping a child in need.\nPersuader: Yes, as do I. I am grateful that there are people like you out there.  I am also very happy that your daughter will be in the nursing profession. It sounds like she comes from a good family!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! You sound like you have a lovely family also!! It was so nice to chat with you. I wish you and your family the best.\nPersuader: Thank you for your $1 donation, and for your time and conversation. :)\n\tPersuadee: Take care and thank you!", "label": [[17, 76, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [110, 125, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [126, 209, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [210, 265, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [370, 391, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [412, 416, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [588, 619, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [916, 967, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [968, 1043, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1403, 1509, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1511, 1580, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1580, 1701, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1889, 1920, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1889, 1920, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2150, 2290, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2615, 2683, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2684, 2729, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2729, 2803, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [126, 209, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [353, 369, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [392, 411, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [417, 468, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [620, 706, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [707, 729, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [2040, 2088, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2088, 2145, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2145, 2148, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [2554, 2574, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [2575, 2614, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [3210, 3270, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [3270, 3308, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [2804, 2857, "3-EMOTION-HUMOUR"], [2858, 2896, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2897, 2985, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [3700, 3749, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [4057, 4101, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [4253, 4323, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [3210, 3270, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [3309, 3390, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [3391, 3449, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [3448, 3583, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [3584, 3602, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [3799, 3821, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [3911, 3924, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [3925, 3980, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [3982, 4056, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"]], "idx": "845"}
