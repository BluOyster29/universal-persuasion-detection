Children in developing nations die from hunger and disease every day. They use their funding to help change that\n\tPersuadee: And there aren't other organizations doing the same?\nPersuader: I'm sure there are, but Save the Children has high rankings for their good work and charity. You can see information about it on their website:  URL s/about-us/awards-and-rankings\n\tPersuadee: So what is done with the moeny they get?\nPersuader: The money goes right towards helping children! For instance, they've been helping children in Syria who are growing up facing the violence there.\n\tPersuadee: And the money doesn't mysteriously disappear at the borders between nations?\nPersuader: As I mentioned, they are a highly ranked charity. Charity Navigator gives them 3 of 4 stars based on their efficiency and capacity.\n\tPersuadee: But there are higher ranked charities, such as Christian Relief Fund\nPersuader: Save the Children isn't a religious organization, it has no agenda except to help children around the world. \n\tPersuadee: Perhaps, though I don't recall a case of religion inhibiting what Christian Relief Fund does.\nPersuader: In any case, I'm sure you can agree that saving children around the world is a worthy cause. A much more meaningful way to use your spare change than buying a coffee or a bag of chips from the vending machine. Small donations make a huge impact on the children and their families.\n\tPersuadee: True, much more worthy then Starbucks\nPersuader: So, how much would you be willing to donate to this charity now? You can choose any amount up to $2\n\tPersuadee: Regrettably I can't give anything, but I have given to others recently.", "label": [[11, 17, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [47, 105, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [378, 521, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [598, 691, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [691, 777, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [842, 987, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1088, 1219, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1312, 1421, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1881, 1980, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [185, 337, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [409, 478, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [902, 987, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [1539, 1748, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1749, 1819, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"]], "idx": "960"}

How are you?\nPersuader: I\\'m alright, just reading up on this organization called \"Save the Children\".. have you heard about it?\n\tPersuadee: I haven't. It sounds familiar though. Could you tell me about it?\nPersuader: Yeah, no problem! It's a non-governmental organization that helps with children's rights. They claim to provide relief and support to kids in developing countries. \n\tPersuadee: That's amazing. Do they provide legal help or support to live?\nPersuader: It looks like a bit of both! But they're down on donations. Curious, how willing would you be to donate to the cause? Say... if it were deducted from your task payment?\n\tPersuadee: I'm really passionate about children's rights no matter what background they are from. When it isn't available, I think it's important to provide for them if we can. So, I'd be willing to donate, if I could confirm the charity was a legitimate one.\nPersuader: Absolutely! Save the Children is quite credible, and has tons of information out there about their organization. They have corporate partnerships, individuals, and foundations!  \n\tPersuadee: Oh, wow! Okay, I would definitely donate to them!\nPersuader: That's so awesome to hear! How much were you thinkin? You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment. \n\tPersuadee: I'm not sure how much I would be getting from the task, but I will say $1!\nPersuader: That's so awesome of you! The research team will be able to collect all donations and send it on over to Save the Children. It's a very valuable cause, and afterall, they have won up to 7 awards. \n\tPersuadee: Oh, that is nice! Especially now with so many children separated from their families because of the immigration disputes, I hope they can help children here even in America as well!\nPersuader: They absolutely have United States based programs! From Avocacy, to Education, and even emergency services. I worry about those kids too, so I understand. It's a shame what's going on, I hope the problem gets rectified soon. \n\tPersuadee: Me too. I think about them so often. I have a sister who is under eighteen. I try to teach her about her rights because I think it is so important to know them. If someone believes they can take advantage of your ignorance, a lot of times, they will. It's a shame, but I want her to know her rights so that she is never taken advantage of by someone in a higher position of power. Wherever and whoever that may be.\nPersuader: I want to teach my daughter the same someday! It's even harder seeing the things going on here on the news and in the media when you have a child that's so close to you :(\n\tPersuadee: Yes. It makes me scared for her and my nephews as well. I hope we can fix the bad in the world by the time they grow older. I have noticed so many kids that are kinder and more aware than when I was younger. I think it's because there are more people who have experienced injustice or have been hurt by inequality. They want to make sure it doesn't happen to the ones that come after us.\nPersuader: I agree! I think that the internet helps, too. Helps to bring awareness. It was very kind of you, today, to donate your earnings from this chat for the kids. I understand the grind of trying to make a buck, and I just wanted to leave you off with one thing: you heard about saving children and you committed. That's so big of you, and not many people care these days. I admire you, and I hope you have a wonderful day. :)\n\tPersuadee: Thank you.

Tell me more about this charity before I make a decision.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a foundation that runs world-wide with a focus on providing health, education, protection, hunger elimination, emergency aid, and global advocacy. So far we have reached 155 million children in 120 countries.\n\tPersuadee: Interesting that you know so much.  How long has this charity been around?\nPersuader: The charity was founded in 1919 and their belief is that every child deserves a future so nearly 90% of every dollar goes directly into the mission itself while the remaining 10% goes directly into fundraising and advocacy awareness programs to help promote their current efforts. \n\tPersuadee: That is important that most of the money goes to the charity and not into administration.\nPersuader: Agreed, they post their yearly audit reports so that individuals can track where the funds are allocated.\n\tPersuadee: It looks like they will be celebrating their 100 year anniversary soon. That is quite a milestone.\nPersuader: Yes, they are an extremely reputable charity that have been in good standing for the entirety of their history. Originally founded immediately after World War I when so many children were orphaned and/or homeless. \n\tPersuadee: That is interesting.  Do they do work in the United States or just overseas?\nPersuader: They work world wide providing both support in the US and overseas, the US chapter was founded in 1932 following the great depression, and today their team goes where other's cannot - to the most rural communities in the US. Last year, they provided support to 237,000 US children across 22 states and Puerto Rico.\n\tPersuadee: What country outside of the US do they do the most help for?\nPersuader: Other than the US, Africa receives 43% of the budget, helping more than 32 million children in 2016 across Burkina Faso, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\tPersuadee: Interesting. Yes I see that most children are helped in Africa.\nPersuader: Right. So, can I interest you in making a donation from your reward today?\n\tPersuadee: Although I do appreciate all of your info, I am not interested in making a donation at this time.\nPersuader: Are you certain? Just a small donation can make a large impact on the entire life of a child and allow them to receive proper medical care and education, food and safety.\n\tPersuadee: I understand, but I already have charities that I support on my own.

But before you decide hastily, I would like to remind you that Save the Children is one of the only charities doing what it does. There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted. So please, consider thoughtfully whether you would be willing to make a sacrifice for the children of the world.\n\tPersuadee: how do i trust the organiation?\nPersuader: Save the Children is a world-renowned NGO with a trusted history and background. You can read about their successes on their website:   URL Also, they have been given high ratings from different charity watchodgs.\n\tPersuadee: okay i will check it.. by the way how much did you donate?\nPersuader: I donated $2, which is the maximum payment. I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.\n\tPersuadee: okay i will donate $1\nPersuader: If it's not too much to ask, I would like you to consider donating perhaps more. After all, there are children in Syria now growing up facing threats of violence everyday.

{"id": 2367, "data": "Persuader: How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\n\tPersuadee: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nPersuader: I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses. I think the work that charities can do is so important. Especially when it is a legitimate charity that is dedicated to doing better. Have you heard about the charity Save the children?\n\tPersuadee: yes I have. In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nPersuader: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\n\tPersuadee: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nPersuader: I agree. It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\n\tPersuadee: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. \nPersuader: I agree. I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? \n\tPersuadee: Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.\nPersuader: I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. I think most people would help just to help. Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  \n\tPersuadee: I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.\nPersuader: I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help. Do you think people would be more likely to donate if they say the impact very small donations could have? Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what?\n\tPersuadee: Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. \nPersuader: I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it. At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity. Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time\n\tPersuadee: Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say \"maybe next time\" if they aren\\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\\'t have the funds to do so. When I really think about it, people will carry the right amount of change just to buy one item that they initially came to the store to buy. \nPersuader: This chat allows you to donate some of your task payment to Save the children. The research team collects all the donations people elect to give and send them to save the children to help support the work that they do globally.  Do you think that you would elect to give some of your task payment?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I would. I'm in the process of racking up as much money as I can and donating part of that to Save the children. \nPersuader: That is amazing. To be honest, I have really enjoyed your opinions on charitable giving like this. How much of your task payment do you want to donate now? You can choose any amount from $0 to all\n\tPersuadee: I can do 0.30 cents at the moment.

I would also donate money if I can. Have you donated to them or do you have any plans to?\nPersuader: I have, in the past. I had a sponsored child. Theyre a good charity actually, one of the few who actually give your donation to the family directly, rather than \"admin expenses\" etc!\n\tPersuadee: Oh I never knew you could sponsor a child through them. Although my mum sponsors a child through World Vision, I do not contribute to it. Any other children related charity's you donate to?\nPersuader: This is the only one. Theyre pretty awesome as I said. You gotta save those children lol. You can actually donate all or any amount of the bonus you will be rewarded from this hit\n\tPersuadee: True that hahahahaha. However, I am very young and a student with no part time job. This is funding for my items I want to buy from Amazon. However, in the past with my allowances, I donated to UNICEF for kids in third world countries who are unable to purchase study equipment. Are you in a financially high position to be able to donate?\nPersuader: I dont think anyone here is :P Im certainly not! I hear ya, I use this $ to buy vitamins and stuff from amazon too\n\tPersuadee: That is very true. I guess if we aren't in a position to donate wealthy sums of money to unfortunate kids we shouldn't even if our minds want to. I would however donate to any charities who help unfortunate kids if I get in the financial position to in the future. Would you?\nPersuader: Yup, totally. I do even now, but not regularly. Are there homeless in/beggars, etc in Australia? Do u ever give to them? Give to the kids instead. A new goat is much better than a Fosters for a wino!\n\tPersuadee: Yes their are a lot. I live in the city and I see them on the daily. I do give them some food not money from time to time. I agree that giving the homeless money directly is not the best idea. Do you prioritise children charities or other general charities that help for example the homeless?\nPersuader: I give to homeless, yup, food sometimes (its funny how hungry they suddenly aren't sometimes, when you offer a burger or something) I give em cash too, though I should save all that change and send it to the children. I think it would probably be better spent but I try not to be too judgemental, plus, you know, those guys just come up on ya sometimes, I just automatically give it to em usually.. \n\tPersuadee: Fair enough. I always prioritise children charities as I believe they are important to the future of this world. They are what will make the world a better place and I believe they should all have an equal chance no matter the position they are in. \nPersuader: Agreed... So, hopefully you'll consider giving even just a little of your bonus to Save The Children at the end. Even just a few cents, multiplied through all the participants could be pretty significant\n\tPersuadee: That is very true. Small donations can make a big difference. I will actually consider that. The minimum donation is $2 so that is a potential to donate $2. Where do you think there are the most unfortunate kids?\nPersuader: Africa? So sad, the politics there. South America? Crazy mad poverty... What do u think?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I'll have to agree Africa. Always the commercials showing unfortunate kids in Africa. Many of them can't even go to school.

Last week CNN talked about the genocides starting in syria\n\tPersuadee: That doesnt sound very good\nPersuader: It's awful. ESpecially since children are being specifically targeted for rape and torture. Some are being sold to ISIS\n\tPersuadee: Always with ISIS. Why can't people just help each other out?\nPersuader: Right? Save the Children, the organization i mentioned before has been helping out a lot in the region. They have been saving 250 kids/week. They want to do more but lack funding\n\tPersuadee: I think lack of funds is always a moot point, because there's never enough\nPersuader: True, but nothing and something are pretty different things. Especially to a kid that is facing a future as a sex slave. I donated a couple bucks last week. It seemed grimy not to\n\tPersuadee: Fair enough, but not everyone has the means to give\nPersuader: That's true, not everyone has the means to give. But I think most can donate a dollar\n\tPersuadee: Ah, yes, the \"if everyone gave a dollar\" argument. It is what gave birth to the whole crowdfunding platform.\nPersuader: It's not an argument. It's a fact that small donations by large numbers of people can have an impact. The merit of the cause is an entirely different matter?\n\tPersuadee: Indeed, but how do we know the donation aren't simply buying another yacht for an executive?\nPersuader: A review of the tax exempt paperwork and financial statements, which are available for all tax exempt organizations, can help you weed out good from bad. Save The Children is transparent\n\tPersuadee: Maybe, but financial statements are always \"summaries\" and not everyone is fluent in legalese\nPersuader: I think you sell people short, especially since we are talking about numbers in a table. People can see where the numbers go. I'm not sure what 'legalese' you refer to. And these statements are not summaries. They detail how every dollar is spent, as required by law.  =)  How much are you going to donate?\n\tPersuadee: Unfortunately, I will not be making a donation today.

Do you know what Save the Children does as a charity?\nPersuader: Yeah, it promotes childrens rights and provides help and support for kids in developing countries. I always try to donate to charities for children\n\tPersuadee: Gotcha, that sounds like a worthy cause.  How do you feel about donating all of the money?\nPersuader: I'd be all for that. It might as well go to kids who are in need. So you would like to donate the full $2?\n\tPersuadee: Yeah, let's go for it.  I'd rather kids in need get the money.  I'm trying to get into the habit of donating more these days, so this is a good way to start\nPersuader: That is awesome, we'll both have done our good deed for the day too\n\tPersuadee: Exactly!  Now I can sleep with a good conscience tonight haha\nPersuader: haha thats right. So I looked at a little more info about the charity and apparently they helped a lot with Syrian children that were targets of violence\n\tPersuadee: Oh man, now I wish I could donate more.  But I bet this 2 dollars will go a long way to helping those kids.  Every little bit counts!\nPersuader: Yeah, two dollars doesnt seem like much to us, but its probably a huge help for children in poverty\n\tPersuadee: It's horrifying to think about what those kids have been through.  I can't begin to imagine how they must feel right now.  It's not fair they are dealing with their situation at that age when all I was worrying about was who was the most popular kid in class.\nPersuader: I agree. Its hard to even think about living in a place that's violent, impoverished and where every day is difficult. It does make our problems seem pretty trivial\n\tPersuadee: I stubbed my toe this morning and thought it was the worst thing ever.  Now, I don't feel that it was all that bad\nPersuader: haha yeah really! I hope other people doing this study decide to donate all of their money too. That would be a lot of help!\n\tPersuadee: Seriously!  It'd be really neat to be able to see how many people donated to the cause\nPersuader: Agreed. Some researchers do send that info out after their studies (maybe they'll see our convo and do it!).  So I think that's our 10 messages. We're agreeing to donate the full amount, right?\n\tPersuadee: That'd be really cool.  Hey researchers, please send us the info!

I know there are often times I regret spending money on that when there are starving kids in the world that could be helped. Do you ever feel that way?\n\tPersuadee: No, not really.  I can count on one hand the number of times I've had starbucks coffee.  Very rarely do I spend money on unnecessary things, money is that tight.  I do feel bad there are starving kids in this world, but until my situation changes, there is nothing I can do for them or anyone else.\nPersuader: I understand. The research team is collecting donations, so if you are willing to give even a few cents from your task payment, I'm sure the charity would be appreciative.\n\tPersuadee: I've done that before on other tasks.  Wouldn't it be easier for the research team to have their survey, and ask for donations at the end of the survey?  \nPersuader: Yes, they are doing what you've described.\n\tPersuadee: So if my reward amount on this hit is .30 cents, just give \"Save the Children\" this .30 cents, and we will call this task complete.\nPersuader: Yes.

{"id": 2378, "data": "Persuader: So how do you feel about giving money to charity?\n\tPersuadee: I generally disagree, I am only willing to give to charity after I have thoroughly researched the organization.\nPersuader: In this instance though, the money you'd be given is freely available to you, and costs you nothing.\n\tPersuadee: I suppose that's true. But how can I give something that isn't mine?\nPersuader: Well it is yours for the purpose of this conversation, and the money would go towards a good cause.  Save the Children is a recognized organization that has promoted children's  rights since 1919.\n\tPersuadee: In that case I would not donate my money.  Every charity that has ever existed said the money would go towards a good cause.  I know nothing about Save the Children other than what you've just told me.\nPersuader: Well the organization does have consultative ties to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.  They provide aid to children for education, health care, economic opportunities, along with emergency aid during natural disasters, war and other conflicts.  They've provided aid during the Russian famine in 1921, were among the first into liberated areas after World War 2 to work with refugee children and survivors of Nazi concentration camps, etc.\n\tPersuadee: I'd have to research several sources, and documentation for myself.  Although the face of any charity looks good, I don't trust any charity until I've seen proof.\nPersuader: Well they are highly rated, with Charity Navigator give them a score of 88.3 out of 100.  Would you be willing to give at least a small portion of the money you have?\n\tPersuadee: Nope, never heard of Charity Navigator, but it sounds like a good place to start.\nPersuader: Are you sure not even a small amount.  They instituted the Rewrite the Future global campaign in 2006 that focused on obtaining equal and quality education for children who are unable to attend school due to conflict or war. The campaign is focused in 28 states where armed conflict is particularly relevant including Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Indonesia, Liberia, Nepal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and Uganda.  In 2008, they surpassed their goal by improving education standards for 10 million instead of 8.\n\tPersuadee: I'm sure, like I said, that sounds great, but anyone can say anything is true.  I need proof.\nPersuader: Well I can link their website right now for you to glance over:  URL \n\tPersuadee: That looks like a great organization. But I have to be clear, I've studied the wrong doings of large institutions, and there is potential for the funds to line somebody's pockets, instead of helping more. For example, even good organizations pay companies to solicit for them, those companies keep 85-90% of all donations.  I'm not taking a chance.\nPersuader: But they've won multiple awards from a list of non-profit grading organizations include Great Noprofits, GuideStar Platinum, and most importantly the Better Business Bureau that rates based on utilization of funds.\n\tPersuadee: That's cool, never heard of Great Noprofits or GuideStar Platinum, so those awards mean nothing to me right now. I'm familiar with the BBB but not how they rate charities.\nPersuader: Well, the BBB rates and accredits charities based on 20 criteria.  These include board oversight, size, conflicts of interest, program expenses, auditing reports, test for accurate expense reporting, website disclosures, include any true complaints against the charity, effectiveness policy, budget plan, etc.  They passed all 20 criteria.\n\tPersuadee: Well that's good to know.  But it still isn't something I have researched myself.  No way am I willing to give any amount of money away to an organization I've only heard about just a few minutes ago.\nPersuader: If you're worried about how the money is spent, the BBB reported Save the Children committed 122 million to education, 205 million to emergencies, 144 million to health/nutrition, 42 million to HIV/AIDS, etc.\n\tPersuadee: Great, I still need to see it for myself.\nPersuader: Well all I could do was provide that information, and let you make up your own mind.

{"id": 2379, "data": "Persuader: Are you interested in bettering the rights of children in developing countries? There are many children starving all over the world, unable to attend their school classes, and dying from treatable diseases.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I am very interested in helping children from developing countries, because they have done nothing to deserve that horrible life.\nPersuader: I am collecting donations for a charity called Save the Children! We are a non governmental organization the helps support children in third world and developing countries. We are an international organization that supports children's rights, and are working to help provide these necessities. Would you like to know more? \n\tPersuadee: Yes, I would be happy to learn more about \"Save the Children\". I like the name of the organization and I hope that they will succeed in helping the suffering children. \nPersuader:  Every day around the world 22,000 children die (according to UNICEF survey 2018) due to complications arising from poverty. Children as young as 4 are forced to work long hours in unsafe conditions, unable to go to school to better their situations. In addition to poverty, war torn countries such as Syria have subjected millions of children to a daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, more than 1,000 children were reported killed just in Syria. Do you have any questions about the organization so far?\n\tPersuadee: Does the organization help children to get out of the war from Syria? Do they make sure that the children can be taken to a safe place to avoid the destruction of the conflict in Syria?\nPersuader: Save the Children participates in a number of child protection programs that are designed to work with governments to develop and implement protective policies for children. Inside Syria, we're on the ground, ensuring children are safe, cared for and learning. We're providing lifesaving services and supplies. We're tending to children's physical and psychological needs. And we're setting up safe places for children in crisis to learn and play, critical for child development. Despite extreme humanitarian challenges, we've helped 2.5 million people in Syria, including 1.7 million children. \n\tPersuadee: That's amazing and wonderful that your organization was able to save millions of Syrians suffering. I know that their safety and well being is the most important for a child to grow. Their medical health need to come first and safety. \nPersuader: I agree. Syria is statistically the most dangerous place to be a child - of all conflicted-affected countries in the world. Save the Children is doing whatever it takes to end this war on childhood - so Syria's children have a future. Today I have an opportunity for you to donate to Save the Children, at no out of pocket cost to yourself. Are you interested?  \n\tPersuadee: Yes, I like everything you told me about the \\'Save the Children\" organization. I am very much interested in donating today.\nPersuader: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the cause. I would like to let you know that a donation as small as 77 cents can help to house a refugee family for a day, and unlike other organizations that only donate 10% or less, we keep a low administrative cost so that 86% of all donations are used directly to help support these children in need. Your donation with be directly deducted from your task payment. Do you have any further questions I can answer for you today?\n\tPersuadee: I think you have answered all my questions honestly and upfront and I appreciate your hard work. I am happy to donate 2.00 today to \"Save the Children\" and help save the children that need the most help in face of death. Thank You.\nPersuader: Your gift, pooled with other support, will help us deliver critical aid to children and families around the world and the US during emergencies and within our programs. Thank you very much! I appreciate your time today.\n\tPersuadee: You are very welcome and I am please to help this wonderful organization and provide some financial help. \nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send them directly to Save the Children at the end of this task.

Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.

Here is the website:  URL \n\tPersuadee: Great@ thank you for the imformation. do you have any other personal opinions about the Save the Children fund?\nPersuader: Of course! Personally, one of the things that stirs compassion for me is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

I also tutored kids at a battered woman's shelter. I have a bunch of baby clothes inwant to donate as well.

What do you think is the best solution or way to help for the average person like you or Me to render aid?\nPersuader: Save the Children works with government around the world to keep children from harm and abuse from crises situations by providing safe spaces for children to play, socialize, learn, and express themselves as they rebuild their lives. Child Friendly Spaces also serve as a protective mechanism from abuse and psychosocial distress helping children both during and following crises.\n\tPersuadee: So you think monetary donations are the best course of action?

You seem partial to save the children. Do you have any personal connection with that charity?\nPersuader: I have worked with some charities in the past, Our Daily Bread for one, and I like the fact that Save the Children's focus is solely on the welfare of children. They are a particularly vulnerable group and I find it reassuring that nearly 90% of every dollar you give goes straight to their mission _ helping children grow up healthy, learning and safe. This percentage is adjusted each year end _ as of 2017, it is 86%. The rest they for running their programs and raising funds to help more children.  \n\tPersuadee: I used to manage a store and we often picked childrens charities to give to. It always bothered me when folks would say '' need y'all to donate to me' and then decline to donate. I think people fail to realize that without healthy, cared for, nurtured children, our future as a humanity becomes jeapodized.\nPersuader: Would you help out in this small way?

You're not one of those Skynet agents, are you?\n\tPersuadee: Hey, I'm doing good. Not a Skynet agent but wish I was though. How are you?\nPersuader: I'm doing pretty well. Almost Friday and the weather's not too hot so it could be a lot worse\n\tPersuadee: Yea. It's actually decent where I am as well. Let's hope it stays that way!\nPersuader: Haha, yea, I've been reading news stories about people sinking into the pavement in Britain of all places. Luckily no one I know in the South has been swallowed up by a road 'cause it's been pretty hot down there too\n\tPersuadee: How does one get swallowed by pavement? I hope the people in third world countries are doing okay. I can't imagine living in 100+ degree weather without air conditioning.\nPersuader: I'm right there with you. There've been a lot of calamities from inclement weather these last few years.

Or maybe it's just more close to home\n\tPersuadee: more close to home? everything okay over there?\nPersuader: Oh, yea, yea, I just meant Puerto Rico is a lot closer than most of these events.

Are you familiar with them?\n\tPersuadee: No. What are they about?\nPersuader: Well, the short answer is that they're an international organization devoted to providing relief and support for children in developing countries. I've only just skimmed the website, but they seem pretty well established. It's  URL if you wanna check it out\n\tPersuadee: Can they be trusted? Too many organizations nowadays with CEO just taking the money for themselves using a cause as their \"front\".\nPersuader: I looked them up on charitynavigator.org, and they got a 3 out of 4 stars. Not perfect, but it's pretty good\n\tPersuadee: Not bad. So why are you talking about them out of all people?\nPersuader: Well, I'm told that you've been given a sum of money, and if you'd like we can give that directly to Save the Children. What do you think?\n\tPersuadee: Ok. I'm listening.\nPersuader: So it's really all up to you. You have to indicate how much you want to donate, and then the researchers monitoring the experiment will send it\n\tPersuadee: How much are my options?\nPersuader: I think it's whatever you're willing to give. I don't know how big of a stipend they've given you. There's no information about payment options on my end\n\tPersuadee: I'll donate $0.50.\nPersuader: Okay, $0.50 for Save the Children. That'll do.

We keep administrative costs low so that more funding goes to children's programs.\n\tPersuadee: that is reassuring.

I'm glad it's almost the weekend.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I always look forward to the weekend.  Now college football is fixing to start up and I am even happier!\nPersuader: Yes it is. College football and a 3 day weekend. It can't get much better than that. Who's your team?\n\tPersuadee: I am born and bred TCU football so they are and will always be my team, what about you?\nPersuader: I'm an Auburn fan myself.\n\tPersuadee: How do you think they are going to do this year?  I know Alabama is going to be tough as usual\nPersuader: I think they'll do ok. I expect them to stay at least in the top 15. They're a young team this year, but it seems like they always are. Our QB has had some shoulder issues this offseason so we'll see how that plays out. Our run game should be strong though. Alabama is going to be tough as long as Saban has a hand in that organization.\n\tPersuadee: Isnt Stidham your QB still or is he graduated, I know he was from Baylor and really good!\nPersuader: Yeah he's still there. He did really well last year.\n\tPersuadee: Nice, well we play Ohio State and I think 99% of the country is going to be rooting for us to win because of Urban Meyer lol.\nPersuader: Yeah, hopefully you guys will. Urban's going to be the nasty face of CFB this year.\n\tPersuadee: I just cant believe the flimsy excuses by the university to be honest, all they really care about is winning.\nPersuader: Yeah that's the way it is these days.

I think we will finish in the top3 of the B-12.\nPersuader: I'd like to see someone else besides an SEC team win it honestly. This coming from an unbiased SEC fan.\n\tPersuadee: That is nice, I agree with you about Clemson though, it should be fun though regardless!\nPersuader: Yeah it should be. It's been nice talking to you. I guess I should get to the point of the chat. Would you like to donate any of your earnings to Save The Children?\n\tPersuadee: Sure they are a reputable charity and I have seen their work on TV.

For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. \n\tPersuadee: Wow, it is great that these children have a charity to help them.\nPersuader: Very much so!

I think it has to do with helping sick children.\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization. It's mission is promote children's rights, provide relief and aid children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: That is a great cause. However, I am of the opinion that we should provide relief to causes in our country first. Especially animal organizations.\nPersuader: While it is true that relief is also needed domestically. The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own. Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.\n\tPersuadee: that is true. I guess I am naive and like to live in ignorance where it is bliss. How do you feel about animal charities?\nPersuader: This is where your donation would help make a difference for these children. Your donation would assist the Save the Children organization in promoting their mission statement. Small donations really do add up and make a difference. Finally, I am also a fan of animal charities.\n\tPersuadee: That is true that it requires very little money to help children in developing nations. So you charity of choice is Save the Children? Or do you donate to other ones also?\nPersuader: My charity of choice is Save the Children. I strongly identify with their causes and goals.\n\tPersuadee: Do you donate money only? Or do you also volunteer your time?\nPersuader: I donate money to this organization and would encourage you to do the same. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.\n\tPersuadee: I would be willing to donate 10 cents. I make large donations every year so my budget is limited. But I do agree with the points you made in support. Would you consider volunteering time in addition to money?\nPersuader: I appreciate your help in supporting this cause. I would consider volunteering my time in addition to the money. I believe it would be a valuable experience. What other charities do you support or is your charity of choice?\n\tPersuadee: My charity of choice is the italian gryhound florida rescue group. They save miniture IG dogs. I adopted one years ago and she is the best. But children's charities are great too. Are you familiar with the one where they make dreams come true?\nPersuader: That is great! Animal charities are pretty great too! And I'm only familiar with the name with organization that make dreams come true, but nonetheless would like to learn more about them.\n\tPersuadee: Celebrities often get involved and donate time. It's really cool. I think Disney World participates too.\nPersuader: That sounds awesome and am glad to see celebrities get involved. Their involvement often helps to expand these charities' missions. \n\tPersuadee: For sure. It gets the word out and makes people want to follow suit. Plus it is good for celebs because it gets people to have soft spots for them.\nPersuader: I definitely agree with all those points.

For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. \n\tPersuadee: Ok How can I help\nPersuader: Well, you know how much money we spend on unnecessary stuff like a bag of chips or some candy? \n\tPersuadee: No I do not.\nPersuader: Well, It\\'s a lot!

It sounds like a good charity. Are you thinking of donating to it?\nPersuader: I am thinking about it. I was hoping you would think about it too. It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I definitely understand you. It is very difficult to see on the news what is happening in Syria and the violence and terrorism that is going on in the country\nPersuader: I know it is crazy. Sometimes I think about the little things I buy. Like yesterday I had a craving for candy so I bought a bag of smarties for $2.79. Sometimes I wonder how much it could help someone else instead of just satisfying my cravings.\n\tPersuadee: Yes that is very true. I usually donate $1.00 or $2.00 at restaurants or stores whenever they ask me if I would like to donate. I think it is the least I could do.\nPersuader: That is nice. I try to do the same if I have the extra money. Usually it is not something I am a strong believer in though. I really like helping others that in third world countries that have no idea what wealth is.\n\tPersuadee: Yes I understand. I have been to third world countries in South America and seeing the living conditions of some people is very tough. The poverty there is a lot higher than what we are used to seeing and it can be shocking.\nPersuader: I have only been to Mexico and that was an eye opener. One dollar is so valuable to them. It is crazy!\n\tPersuadee: Yes I know. Any amount of money can help. I think that we take many things for granted such as running water, and always having food on the table.\nPersuader: Right!

The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: I would like to donate $.50\nPersuader: That is amazing! Thank you so much.

That makes me happy.\nPersuader: Thank you again for your generous donation.\n\tPersuadee: You're welcome.
