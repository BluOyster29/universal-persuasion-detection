It\\'s an organization that provides relief to children in developing countries and promotes their rights.\n\tPersuadee: Actually yes, I have heard of this organization. I believe they have a good reputation. \nPersuader: They do. There are a number of similar organizations but Save The Children is probably the one with the highest reputation. They do a great job and make a serious impact on a lot of lives that might otherwise be lost. They reduce a LOT of suffering.\n\tPersuadee: Do you know how they use the money? Does it go directly to children and their families? Or does it go to a \"hand out\" type of administration? \nPersuader: They say that independant audits show that 9 out of 10 dollars donated go to programs. They do their best to keep their administrative costs low to maximize how much goes to help.\n\tPersuadee: I do like that. It is important when I consider my giving that the money goes as directly to the afflicted people as it is able. I don't like wastefulness of advertising or self promotion. \nPersuader: Why I ask is that the study has given you an opportunity to donate to the organization. Do you think you would like to donate?

That's what I would suggest. I wouldn't want to ask you to give up all your reward.\n\tPersuadee: It is such a small amount I think I could do better than a dollar. Do you ever know what part of the world your donation ends up in? \nPersuader: My research shows they do things all over the world, but I would expect that right now they're concentrating on war zones with lots of refugees, like Syria and several places in Africa where there's fighting.\n\tPersuadee: That would be a great use of their resources. \nPersuader: There are thousands of Syrian children who have grown up in refugee camps, never knowing home.

Would you like to donate a dollar or more to them?\n\tPersuadee: well that would be a good but I would want to research them first to make sure they are good but maybe you have already done that\nPersuader: I have done my research and I can tell you they are a great organization full of kind / sincere people.\n\tPersuadee: that's great maybe we could both donate to them\nPersuader: Yes that is a great idea.

Random survey.\nPersuader: Well, we just need to discuss a social issue, one very near to my heart.\n\tPersuadee: Ok, sounds good. What issue?\nPersuader: Chidren's welfare. You know how you feel when you read about some abused child?\n\tPersuadee: oh ok, yes, I do.,\nPersuader: Well, that's great, but you know the BIGGEST problem is kids with poor parents (or no parent around), not the ones that are mistreated.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I do think that is an important issue to consider.\nPersuader: Do you know any children personally who show up for school half-dressed or hungry?\n\tPersuadee: I do not.\nPersuader: That's good. Unfortunately I do, and for all the church groups and local government efforts, they continue to suffer.\n\tPersuadee: I see. It's unfortunate that people, especially children, continue to slip through the cracks of society despite the efforts of these organizations.\nPersuader: Well, government and most local social welfare groups go thru the PARENTS; they provide FAMILY support, and short of abuse there's no way they can force the money to be filtered down to the kids. That's why private welfare groups (many associated with schools, like I was implying) are an important way to address these kids' needs DIRECTLY.\n\tPersuadee: Hm...I wasn't aware it was possible for some of these groups to bypass guardianship of these children and give help to these kids directly. This is the first I've heard of this.\nPersuader: It's not like that: they provide school and after-school meals and social support (like school sorts and groups do.) ALL ABOVE BOAFRD and nothing shady. In fact, what brought me to this survey is pretty amazing (somewhat coincidental!)\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok. That makes sense then.\nPersuader: OKAY, so I am involved with a group called (duh) \"SAVE THE CHILDREN\" and you and I both have the opportunity RIGHT NOW to support this organization with some of what we make on this HIT! I mean it\\'s not like we\\'re beating our brains out on this survey. I think we should agree to donate half (or more) of our compensation to the group.\n\tPersuadee: Sounds good. I'm good with donating half our compensation.\nPersuader: Now you know they are international, not just the US, but I feel all kids deserve a chance. \n\tPersuadee: Even better. I agree completely. \nPersuader: OK thanks. When we submit this hit, this conversation will be reported thru the sponsor, and you will hear back from them when (maybe if) they are able to process the donation to SAVE THE CHILDREN or another child charity.

It's really sunny here. \n\tPersuadee: Oh nice, it's usually super humid and hot outside here but the rain has made it cool down and that is so nice.\nPersuader: It's like that here too in the summer. We should be getting a lot of rain soon because of a tropical storm coming up\n\tPersuadee: That is what we are getting now, you must be close to the Gulf of Mexico also.  Do you normally work online? I do.\nPersuader: I have a part-time job in the real world but I do some online stuff on the side. I'm actually in the northeast part of the country, but when there's a big storm down south we get some of the effects of it. But I hope it doesn't get too bad where you are, it seems like storms get worse and worse every year.\n\tPersuadee: True, they are.  The climate change is due to people I feel.  Like not recycling properly, did you know that there is a giant plastic glob out in the ocean from people throwing away tons of plastic stuff?  It's sad.\nPersuader: Wow I didn't know that, that's pretty gross. Yeah climate change is pretty crazy. And people don't even realize the impact it has on human beings, like the weather and pollution is really affecting agriculture and making it harder to grow crops. And there's all the damage from storms of course, people still struggling months and months after hurricanes.\n\tPersuadee: We were affected by hurricane Harvey and that took months to recover from.  I became Vegan about 2 years ago and since then, it has made me more aware of our environment and the care of animals. I did it for health reasons but it became more than just that for me.\nPersuader: Oh cool I'm vegan too actually. It was the same for me, I made the switch to reduce cancer risk since there's a lot of that in my family, but eventually it became an environmental/animal rights thing. I've been vegan for about 6 years and was vegetarian for about 5 before that. I'm so sorry to hear hurricane Harvey affected you. Were there any government programs or non-profits that helped you to recover?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, the government program actually helped us tremendously. I changed to a Vegan diet due to a Cancer risk as well, every woman but me in my family has had some type of cancer. I actually have converted my elderly mother to a Vegan diet over the last year, she's doing great!\nPersuader: Wow that's really great to hear! My parents won't go vegan or vegetarian themselves but have definitely started making healthier choices since I went vegan. I guess every little effort helps, right? And that's really good to know you got help when you needed it. There's a charity called Save the Children that's still helping kids in Texas fully recover from Harvey. You can actually donate a small amount from your task payment today to support them. Would you be interested in helping them out?\n\tPersuadee: Yes every little bit does help, the saying \"You plant a seed.....\" applies.  Yes i\\'ve heard of Save the Children, i would love to donate some of my earning to them, yes.\nPersuader: Awesome, how much would you like to donate? You can pick any amount and it will be deducted from your task payment.\n\tPersuadee: I will donate 1.00 to Save the Children, which is half of my earnings.  Thank you!\nPersuader: That's really great, thank you! Can I ask how you first heard about Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I think it was on television.  They did a like a 30 minute show to bring awareness to the Charity.  They are a very good charity.  I'm not able to conceive a child so I would love helping other people children in need.\nPersuader: Wow yeah, that's a really great way to pay it forward if you aren't able to have kids yourself. Well thank you again for your donation, I'm glad this charity has your support.\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for the great conversation and for telling me about the charity helping Texas children.

{"id": 2565, "data": "Persuader: Hello there, how are you?\n\tPersuadee: Hi\nPersuader: How much do you know about Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I know that it is a charity.  I think I have seen some commercials for it in my lifetime.\nPersuader: Were you aware that Save the Children assists both children in the U.S. as well as foreign countries?\n\tPersuadee: No.  I figured they just tried to help children in under developed countries.  That's great that they help people in the U.S. as well!  I think it's important to help children from our country and also others.  \nPersuader: Yes, not only do we help out with literacy and school related causes, but also with feeding, shelter, and disaster relief for children all over the world.\n\tPersuadee: That's wonderful!  Are you a top rated charity?  How much goes to administrative costs?\nPersuader: We are a top rated charity, and have been around for nearly 100 years! Nearly 90% of our funds go straight to children, with the remainder going to fundraising costs and only 5% for admin costs.\n\tPersuadee: Wow!  That's really great!  I've seen companies go to 70% and I can't help but judge them for it.  I think this is a fair percentage to have.\nPersuader: We try our best to keep the children first, and have done so in aiding millions of children over the years.\n\tPersuadee: I think that's great!  What country is in the most need right now?\nPersuader: Both Africa and USA currently have the highest number of children in need.\n\tPersuadee: That's sad that a country as powerful as the USA still has problems with children in need.\nPersuader: It is very sad, but with the help of so many millions of caring people we are able to enrich the lives of so many.\n\tPersuadee: What is the money used for mostly?  Food?  Toys?  Clothes?  I think this is all very interesting stuff.  I've never had the chance to talk to a charity before.\nPersuader: Monies go to sustain the lives of children in environments in which basic necessities are lacking. For example,Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. \n\tPersuadee: That's terrible.  I hope this kind of environment changes for them.  Children deserve to be in a safe place and to feel secure.\nPersuader: Well, each day children are able to get such needs met by the generosity of those even with donations as small as the cost of about $1 a day. A little goes such a long way!\n\tPersuadee: I can imagine!  I hope lots of people donate to you.

I'd rather donate locally\nPersuader: I agree donating locally is also important.  However, there are so many children that could benefit from just pennies. \n\tPersuadee: Again, no thank you\nPersuader: It will go to a trustable fund.

Anywhere from a penny to $2\n\tPersuadee: I will donate 0\nPersuader: Just 77 cents could help a refugee family and I will match the donation.\n\tPersuadee: Again, I don't know how else I can say this.

I sponsor two children through them.  Their overhead is very low compared to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds great.  I donate to the Humane Society.

Do the missionaries help with getting aid to the children?  What age is considered for help\nPersuader:   If you really look, you can see the future in every child.
