{"id": 2143, "data": "Persuader: Hello!\n\tPersuadee: Hello\nPersuader: So it looks like you have the option to donate some of your earnings from this task to Save the Children. Have you heard of that charity before?\n\tPersuadee: Know I have not. Please explain to me in detail\nPersuader: It's an international organization that supports children in developing countries. It helps children get access to health, education, safety, etc.\n\tPersuadee: Okay. What is the organization called?\nPersuader: It's called Save the Children. It's a rather large organization and well known, you can search for it outside this chat. It's not just a made up organization for the sake of the chat. Do you donate much to charity now?\n\tPersuadee: O I have heard of Save the children. I think I have seen commercials on tv advertising the charity. Currently I do not donate to charities. I wish to and I like the idea of charity donantions, but personal donations is not within my current budget. I am a single mother and fiances are pretty tight at the moment.\nPersuader: I understand. I'm in a similar situation, and I'm hoping to buy a house soon with my boyfriend. I'd guess that's why we're both on mechanical turk early on a Sunday. However, donating to charity does help those even less fortunate than me, so I try to carve out some money here and there to help out. It seems like this would be an easy way to send some money to organization that could really use it, and it wouldn't take any extra time, either.\n\tPersuadee: I really do want to participate but I can't make any donations today. I hope I can still participate in the chats without donating.\nPersuader: I don't think you have to donate by the rules of the chat, but when you think about it, it's often the first, smallest donation that can be the hardest and the most rewarding. If you donated less than a dollar you might not notice that in your own household budget, but combined with all the other donations from this task it could make a huge difference in the life of children who have no parents to take care of them, or children who are fleeing violence or starvation\n\tPersuadee: Okay. So if I decide to make a small donation, do I donate by using my mturk earnings?\nPersuader: Yes, I believe so. Based on what I'm reading in the directions, you'd donate from the earnings you'd get from doing this task\n\tPersuadee: Okay that is nice and simple. \nPersuader: Absolutely! I agree. I really enjoy when things like this are easy to do. I don't know how much time we have left to chat, but it's been great to (electronically) meet you!\n\tPersuadee: It has been great to electronically meet you too. I am not sure how much time we have left and I don't know what to next ha ha.\nPersuader: Oh wait, we need at least 10 minimum chat turns. So we'll need to chat a little bit more about donations; is there any particular issue going on with children in the world today that you've been following in the news or that you care more about?\n\tPersuadee: So when it comes to issues, a specific issue that I really care about is the problem with the poverty issue in the United States. To be specific I worry about the homeless rate with children. For example, myself being from Albuquerque New Mexico, the number of homeless children and teenagers is heartbreaking. And what about you?\nPersuader: I agree. I grew up in California, lived in Louisiana, and then moved to Massachusetts. There's different kinds of childhood poverty between those three states and I wish there was more I could do to help. If you're an adult and you're homeless it's a very different situation than being 6 years old and homeless. We talk a lot about children in other countries, but there's a lot of need for American children too. I'm hoping you'll keep half for you and your own child, and half for Save the Children too!\n\tPersuadee: That is cool that you lived in three different states. Before I lived in New Mexico I also lived in Wisconsin and Minnesota. There is a poverty problem in all three states, but out of the three states that I lived,  New Mexico is definitley the top state for the poverty issue.  I completely agree with you. I feel like our country does not focus enough on our issue with poverty. Especially with children. The issue with children poverty has to change.I will take the option of donating into consideration.\nPersuader: Absolutely! It was great meeting you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your morning.\n\tPersuadee: You as well.

Whats their overall goal?\nPersuader: Well, a very specific goal right is to help the children that are separated from their parents due to our current immigration problem. Can you imagine someone taking your small child away from you and not knowing where they are going, who is going to be caring for them, or if you will ever be able to see them again? As a mother, that thought is horrifying. \n\tPersuadee: It is horrifying, I could not even imagine. What do you need me to do?\nPersuader: Save the Children has committed to providing some of the care and needs for these children until they can be reunited with their parents. Would you be willing to donate your pay for this task to Save the Children so they can continue to provide care for these misplaced children? \n\tPersuadee: My pay? As in my weekly paycheck? Or are there any other payment options, as I have bills to pay.\nPersuader: No, but you could donate part of your pay for this particular task here. Say, maybe half of your payment for this task or even the whole thing?\n\tPersuadee: I will happily donate my whole payment for this task. :)\nPersuader: Thank you! Save the Children is a very reputable charity and your donation will mean so much!\n\tPersuadee: I am so grateful there is a way for me to help financially!!!\nPersuader: It really is a great charity and has been around for over 100 years! And while the current immigration crisis is a relatively new problem, they stand ready to help in whatever capacity they can.\n\tPersuadee: That is fantastic to hear!!\nPersuader: It has been a pleasure chatting with you and donating your task pay to this fine cause should get you some good Karma for the remainder of your day!!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! You will as well for all the hard work you're putting towards this magnificent charity. \nPersuader: You are quite welcome!!\n\tPersuadee: You can send me the information with the email you have on file for me. :)\nPersuader: ok, I will get it out to as soon as possible!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you so much for your time and the effort you are putting towards this very reputable charity!!", "label": [[11, 54, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [55, 131, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [260, 369, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [370, 454, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [580, 714, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [715, 897, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [898, 938, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1034, 1171, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1172, 1313, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1509, 1579, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1436, 1508, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1660, 1670, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1671, 1753, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1671, 1753, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1839, 1907, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1908, 2033, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [2085, 2234, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [2358, 2381, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [2480, 2525, "8-NO-PERSUASION"]], "idx": "128"}

Are you a real person or a software?\nPersuader: I am a real person just trying to help\n\tPersuadee: That is awesome, I was just wondering.

I know it's hard to believe but it's true, I've seen it first hand. Plus, by donating it to a place as credible as Save the Children, you know its going where its needed.\n\tPersuadee: Do you know if there is any research done on that? I do believe that you speak the truth, but it would be easier to convince people with actual numbers.

One of the really cool things about this organization is that you can very easily access their financial records and revenue on their website, and you are more than welcome to look that up at  URL but if you were to donate even a fraction of your earnings from this HIT, 86% of that would actually go to the services they are providing for this children in impoverished countries\n\tPersuadee: I'll take a look at it, what happens to the other 14%?\nPersuader: 9% goes toward fundraising and the other 5% goes toward management and other expenses of the actually organization \n\tPersuadee: Yeah, I saw that, last year they made 155 million. Literally 0.1% of Bezos's wealth. Sorry, I'm very salty about this, but you get the point.\nPersuader: Of course, I understand. The rich stay rich. But, not to be pushy, would you like to donate any of the money you would receive for this HIT to this organization?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, it doesn't make sense to complain and not to donate.

I agree about the donation option.\nPersuader: I don't know much about the specific charity, but I'm a mom, and I think it's really important to help kids around the world.  From what I've heard, Save the Children is a great organization that really makes a different.  I've read they've been doing a lot of work in Syria. \n\tPersuadee: What charity are you talking about?\nPersuader: The info that I'm seeing on my end is that we can choose to donate part of what we earn in this task to Save the Children.  It's a large philanthropic organization that works on ensuring children's rights to health, education, and safety.  They have apparently done work recently to help children in Syria impacted by the civil war.  \n\tPersuadee: Do you know how long they've been around?\nPersuader: I don't see any exact date.  However, they have done work to improve access to education, medicine, and food in Darfur and appear to have been working when that area was also impacted by civil war.  \n\tPersuadee: Thanks, what are your contribution plans?\nPersuader: I am debating between 50% and all of the bonus.  So between 1 and 2 dollars.  I think even $1 can make a difference in their efforts.  What about you?\n\tPersuadee: I'm thinking about the same\nPersuader: I think that seems fair.  From the description, they seem to have a pretty low overhead so even $1 will go directly toward the charitable efforts.  They've also apparently been involved in Jimmy Carter's organization that seeks to give kids and families clean water by getting rid of the guinea worm.  The water filters they use only cost $.90\n\tPersuadee: Thanks for those details, I'd give a dollar to help.\nPersuader: Sounds like a good plan. So that $1 will be deducted from the payment.

Sometimes I use my earnings for charity.  \n\tPersuadee: Yes its really helps me as well in my few expenses.\nPersuader: Have you ever done one of those HITs where they ask you to donate to charity?

Do you?\n\tPersuadee: yes lately i\"ve been getting such HItS and i\\'ve completed those nd yes i donated to the charity .\nPersuader: Do you have a favorite charity?  The researchers in this HIT have told me (in my directions on the left of this screen) that we should consider donating some of our earnings to charity.  \n\tPersuadee: No not in particular.There are no search directions given to me and i can't even find anything on the left side of the screen\nPersuader: Oh!  I guess because I was the one who had to initiate the conversation, they gave me some directions to talk about.  They suggest we consider donating part of our earnings to Save the Children.  I'm thinking about donating $.50 of my $2.  It seems like a good organization; have you heard of them?\n\tPersuadee: oh! I wonder why no directions have been given to me, and i haven't heard anything about this organization yet. ye! sounds goo\nPersuader: It's an international organization that helps support children (health, education, safety) in developing countries.  I think I've seen commercials on TV for them, too.  I know they've been around for a while, so I trust that it's a good organization.\n\tPersuadee: Please can you help me with the name of the organization ?\nPersuader: It's called Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: oh! So How many HITs do you complete in a day?\nPersuader: I try to earn $3 a day on mTurk--some days that only takes a couple of HITs, other days it's takes a lot longer.  If I can get $20/week extra, I feel like it was a good week.  \n\tPersuadee: Why don't they give us HITs of 1$ or 2$ everyday? If this happen i will be so happy\nPersuader: Yes!  Well, I think we're getting near the end of this one.  Would you like to donate .50 to Save the Children?  If we both do it, it will still give us 1.50 each and our combined $1 will help feed a child in another country.  Charities like this can make our $1 go a long way.\n\tPersuadee: Yes that sounds great. I had a good time chatting with you\nPersuader: Thank you!

You can actually donate anything from nothing to the full amount listed on the hit.\n\tPersuadee: How could I do this?\nPersuader: You can state specifically how much you like to donate, and the research team will collect donations and sent them to Save the Children after the hit.\n\tPersuadee: Would my HIT get rejected in that case?\nPersuader: No. There won't be any rejection. \n\tPersuadee: Then it's okay, I didn't understand that the 50 cents would have been a bonus on top of the payment.
