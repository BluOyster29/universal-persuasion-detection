To be honest, not having a cell phone is hardly poverty. American children are hardly in the situation that many African children are\n\tPersuadee: I feel that if America is going to be at the forefront of a charity...it should be helping our own...for instance, our veterans are highly under benefited and paid!!!!  Why not give to them!!!  Maybe Africa's government should do something about their needy children since this charity expects the U.S. to do something about theirs!!\nPersuader: Why not be charitable to all?  $2 is hardly a sum to argue about.  17 cents can feed  child overseas.  12 kids could be fed today with that money.  Hope didn't go to Starbucks today and get a $4 coffee.  Now that's a corporate contribution.\n\tPersuadee: No I don't spend my money at Starbucks because they don't support gun rights...  For being an ambassador for this charity you are sure quick into bullying someone to give to this charity!!!\nPersuader: I'm not being a bully. Ok, if $2 is too much, how about $1?  I'm with you on gun rights BTW.\n\tPersuadee: I tell you what I will feed one over sees child at .12, I take these task roles, to make money not give it away...if I wasn't living paycheck to paycheck I would not be doing them.\nPersuader: I'm in the same boat.  I need the money too.  But it wouldn't hurt to give a little.  MTurk doesn't exactly pay subsistence wages.  \n\tPersuadee: Your right, but every little bit helps!

I just read that The United Nations estimated last year 25,000 people still die of hunger daily. That means more than 9.1 million people die of hunger every year.\n\tPersuadee: Yes its such a sad thing to see happen myself and family are very kind hearted and feel for all the people around the world who are suffering from this , And would love to make a change and to help .\nPersuader: Great to hear there are still kind hearted people to help people suffering! It makes me angry to know of so many children in danger in the world.\n\tPersuadee: Yes its so sad how people can go about their day and not think of those who are in great need ! Especially those who are very wealthy themselves and don't care to make a difference \nPersuader: I agree!  I certainly am not wealthy but still try to make donation as often as I can.  There are some wealthy people that are great philanthropists, but I think more people like you and I are needed to make even small donations.  Have you ever been to the Save the Children website?

Yes i do i actually watch a family on youtube that raises money every year live streaming for save the children and all the money they receive goes to save the children   \nPersuader: You can make a donation from your incoming earning from this task to Save the Children.  Even just a small amount makes a difference? I just realized I sound like a telemarketer! Can you donate part of your payment? I think we should.\n\tPersuadee: As of right now i honestly would but i dont have the funds for it if their are other ways im albe to get others to donate as well and help out in any way possible i will be more then willing to do so..\nPersuader: Even just a small donation helps. I will donate again if you match the amount of a snack!  Maybe .50 perhaps?\n\tPersuadee: of course i could do so from my paypal\nPersuader: The research team will collect donations and send it to Save the Children. So we don't even need to use Paypal.\n\tPersuadee: oh okay then thats awsome to hear \nPersuader: Ok great!  I think we are really part of the solution this way. Especially if that story of a child who died makes you angry like me.

{"id": 2304, "data": "Persuader: Hi\n\tPersuadee: Hello\nPersuader: I'm here to talk about the charity Save the Children. It is an amazing charity and is very efficient with their funding.\n\tPersuadee: I think I have heard of it, but do not know that much about it aside from a general idea that they support children\nPersuader: They are an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps children in developing countries. This is a really great opportunity for you to donate your bonus without having to actually give money out of your pocket. \n\tPersuadee: If I am giving money out of my bonus, then it is kind of coming out of my pocket\nPersuader: That is one way to look at it. I think that if you were going to donate at any point, this would be an easy way to do it. Or at least a portion of the bonus. Don't you think donating feels good?\n\tPersuadee: Donating doesn't feel good or bad for myself. It is a means to support something if I think the cause is worthwhile and I trust the charity to spend the money in a way I agree with\nPersuader: That is true, the money is making a real and tangible difference regardless of how it makes you feel. I think that everyone should give a little bit here and there because it really adds up and the money can increase their quality of life likely more than it could for you.\n\tPersuadee: Why would you think that? You really do not know about me or my situation. The fact that we are on here working on surveys may lend to the fact we need money\nPersuader: That is definitely true I can't make any assumptions about you, you could have kids to feed yourself, etc. But all I'm saying is that most of Save the Children's funding goes to third world nations, really terrible places and war-stricken areas. They just want food and water to be happy.\n\tPersuadee: That may be so, and the charity may do good work, I really do not know. That being said, I would rather keep my own money and donate to the charity in my local area as I see fit rather than support someone across the globe \nPersuader: Fair enough, but please consider donating even a tiny fraction of the bonus. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment.\n\tPersuadee: I will keep my bonus and donate $0\nPersuader: Can't blame you for that at all.\n\tPersuadee: Good luck in convincing other's though. While I do not choose to donate, I looked up the charity and it does look to be a decent cause. I just believe in working local first and then worrying about international issues\nPersuader: Makes perfect sense, it is sensible to want to help those you're familiar with. The survey should continue at this point I think.\n\tPersuadee: No idea, I have no button to make it progress. One other idea since I have to wait here anyway. If they really want us to give a portion of our bonus then they should probably offer a bit more of one. As it is we make less than 6 an hour if we keep the full bonus\nPersuader: Yeah that was what I was thinking, the base amount is very low. I think it's waiting for 10 messages each so it should continue now.

Is it some sort of boy band?\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Hm. Isn't this the sort of group that the government should help?\nPersuader: Everything helps, and honestly they could use it more than we could. Children die of hunger everyday and your donation could help prevent that.\n\tPersuadee: At the moment, I'm pretty strapped for cash. In fact, I could probably use a donation!\nPersuader: Well, you could donate anything from $0.01 to $2.00. Would you be willing to donate even $0.01?\n\tPersuadee: What would be the point of donating such a small amount? It would be better to try to find others that could donate more.\nPersuader: No amount is too little unless it is nothing. Save the Children is a well established charity, so they have a large reach and it all adds up. You can check them out at their website:  URL \n\tPersuadee: Where does StC do its work? I've never heard of StC. Is this a real org?\nPersuader: They are a global charity, they also work in the US. You can check out their website, it is indeed a reputable organization. \n\tPersuadee: Have you ever made a donation to them? Or has anyone that you know made a donation? \nPersuader: I have not, but in this instance I wouldn't mind donating. It is just a bonus.\n\tPersuadee: I understand that the organization needs money, like many other worthy charities trying to improve the world. But right now, it's a bit tough for me. I know that you understand.\nPersuader: Well, we will just sit here going back and forth and then neither of us get the bonus? I assure you that even a penny would help.\n\tPersuadee: Would you be willing to donate yourself?\nPersuader: Yes, of course. For all we know this is theoretical money.\n\tPersuadee: How much would you be willing to donate?\nPersuader: I usually do half because I feel it is fair and these organizations could use it more than I could. Anything below a dollar I would consider donating. Do you ever donate to things in your personal life?\n\tPersuadee: No, I never donate. I don't know what organizations do with the money, how efficient they are.\nPersuader: Yeah I understand that.", "label": [[463, 532, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [532, 606, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [716, 769, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [770, 812, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1243, 1368, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [958, 1003, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [1004, 1099, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1477, 1535, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1536, 1555, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [1843, 1886, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [1844, 1886, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [1967, 2009, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [2225, 2276, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1757, 1843, "4-LOGIC-ARGUE"], [2074, 2174, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2174, 2224, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [11, 101, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [205, 373, "5-AUTHORITY-SUPERIOR"]], "idx": "293"}

I have donated to March of Dimes, St Judes, Salvation Army, and a local no kill pet shelter. Have you donated to known causes before?\nPersuader: I have as well to March of Dimes and our local pet shelter. I've also volunteered at the pet shelter. Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I think I have read something on that agency but it has been a long time. Is that the one that you pay so much to help feed them in other countries? \nPersuader: Yes! It's an international organization that helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Ok, yes I know that one. \nPersuader: Do you have children? I have fur babies & a couple nephews.\n\tPersuadee: I have 3 children, dogs and cats. I like to help children in need because I can't imagine what the parents go through and I never know when something may happen close to home and I would want some type of help to get my family through a hard situation. Do you donate to Save the Children\nPersuader: I agree. Times are tough and everyone needs help every now and then. I've recently become aware of Save the Children. I've been supporting a similar organization and would like to add Save the Children to my list. What about you?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, it looks like it is very inexpensive so I would definitely add it to my list when I have extra money to donate. \nPersuader: I read that in the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in the violence in Syria. Save the Children helps kids like that. \n\tPersuadee: That is horrible. I would definitely donate if it helps save even one life. If it helps them get through this then I am all for it. Children shouldn't have to live like that. \nPersuader: It's horrible. What would you say to donating all or part of your income from this task?\n\tPersuadee: I definitely will be donating part of it for sure.\nPersuader: That's great! It will make a tangible impact for sure. They are a trustable fund and make a big impact on these innocent children.\n\tPersuadee: Yes it will!\nPersuader: There's a lack of support for children in developing countries. I tend to think about animals more since I have 2 dogs and no kids of my own but after hearing about all the violence and issues these kids have, it breaks my heart\n\tPersuadee: It's absolutely terrible. I wish people would do more to donate to help these kids but some organizations stole money from people which makes others very leery of donating. That ruined it for many and I'm sure they lost a lot of donations after that. I could not imagine my children living like this and hate seeing other children living like that. I wish I could do more. \nPersuader: Well donating to Save the Children is a good place to start for sure! How much would you like to donate? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2)\n\tPersuadee: I would donate half so $1 would be good for a start. How about you?\nPersuader: That's so great! I will donate .25 cents!

I think it would be wise of us to be part of this noble cause\n\tPersuadee: i completely agree.  it's a crying shame that so many children have to live in terrible circumstances.  these kids have done nothing wrong; it's a terrible situation.  \nPersuader: Indeed. This organization relies on our donations to keep it going. Don't you think we should help it\n\tPersuadee: without a doubt.  i believe in helping just about any charity; i just wish i had more money to offer.  but i do what i can and charities that involve kids are near the top of my list.\nPersuader: Even a small amount can help much. No donation is small and every penny counts towards helping them\n\tPersuadee: that's a wonderful sentiment.  i'd be happy to make a contribution as this sounds like a fine charity that needs assistance.\nPersuader: Glad to hear that there are such kind and caring people like you still live. How much of your incoming payment are you willing to donate today?\n\tPersuadee: i'd be happy to donate the payment for this hit which is $2\nPersuader: That is very generous from your side. May God increase your bounty in this life and bestow you with all His Grace. Those children would indeed be grateful for your act\n\tPersuadee: thank you so much.  I also believe in God; he is a powerful force in my life and I turn to Him for assistance when i'm in trouble.\nPersuader: Being spiritual helps and most importantly helping the servants of God who are in desperate situation will make you even closer to Him\n\tPersuadee: I truly believe in God.  I know we are not expected to understand why He does everything the way He chooses but i don't have to know the reasons to know He exists.\nPersuader: I have to tell helping those children will make you feel good in the long-run. That is the power of charitable actions\n\tPersuadee: indeed.  that's the beauty of giving to charity.  it helps those who receive as well as those who give.  i have made my share of mistakes in my 62 years but i do my best and I try my best to keep God in mind when i make decisions.\nPersuader: Do you often donate to such charities?\n\tPersuadee: not as often as i should.  i'm on a very tight budget because i've made some real bad financial decisions through the years.  i do make a donation each month to the KLOVE radio network which is a commercial free religious network.\nPersuader: I understand and I hope everything will turn into its way as soon as you may expect. I want to make everything clear now. Are you willing now to go ahead and make $2 payment to Save the Children organization?\n\tPersuadee: i certainly am and i look forward to doing so.\nPersuader: We appreciate your concern and we express our sincere gratitude for your generosity.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. \n\tPersuadee: That doesn't really answer either of my questions about the charity, is the money going to Syrian children?\nPersuader: Yes, Syrian children are one of the groups that get the money, I can not personally guarantee the CEO does not get the money, but I know you would feel better helping the children.\n\tPersuadee: That is true, I really would! Maybe I will do some more research on the charity's CEO. Do you know what he is like?\nPersuader: Carolyn Miles is President & Chief Executive Officer of Save the Children, an organization that gives children in the United States and around the world a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. The global Save the Children movement currently serves over 157 million children in the US and in 120 countries. As a global organization, Save the Children has committed to driving down the numbers of preventable deaths of children under 5, ensuring every child gets a high-quality basic education and protecting all children from harm.\n\tPersuadee: Wow! She sounds like an amazing woman! I feel comfortable donating now. Are there any restrictions when it comes to donating, or am I allowed to donate however much I want?\nPersuader: From 0 to all its up to you. Thank you too\n\tPersuadee: No problem, at all! I have decided I would like to donate $5,000 to the children's charity!\nPersuader: THAT IS GREAT:)\n\tPersuadee: Thank you!

Are you aware about what is going on in Syria recently?\n\tPersuadee: If by what is going on Syria you mean the civil war, yes. I'm not too informed on the details, but my assumption, based on what I've seen on the news is that Bashar Al-Asad wants to maintain his position of power while the rebels are trying to overthrow him.\nPersuader: It is unfortunate what is happening there. There has been a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

Medical attention, supplies, shelter, food are provided.

We pretty much are living on a poverty level income with no help from social services.\nPersuader: I'm sorry to hear that.

What are you trying to complete by speaking with me\nPersuader: I would like to ask if you would be willing to donate some or all of your incoming payment for this task to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: Im afraid not. I believe that parents of the child are responsible to take care of their children this is Gods way. If the parent is not there to complete this it is the Churches job. Now we have people that don't go to church because organizations and governments have started doing this.\nPersuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Save the Children does work to help these children in situations that they and their parents are unable to control.\n\tPersuadee: I understands that.

Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I choose $0\nPersuader: Are you sure there is no amount that you would like to donate today?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I am positive\nPersuader: Save the Children is a large organization that has helped many already but relies on donations to continue their good work. How many more children have to suffer?\n\tPersuadee: As long as evil is in the world people that shouldn't suffer will. So wouldn't you say that money only mask the problem. ( Just as medication doesn't fix most diseases just mask symptoms). We need to fix the problem not mask it\nPersuader: Organizations such as Save the Children are trying to reduce some of the evil and suffering in the world by spreading help and relief. Even if it does not fix the problem, can't you say that is can help give a child a fighting chance to hopefully help end the cycle of evil?\n\tPersuadee: I would like to know how much the executives or (consultants) get paid to help this organizations efforts\nPersuader: In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services. 9% was used to promote fundraising. Only 5% of all expenditures were spent on Management.\n\tPersuadee: How much was made not percentages\nPersuader: The total operating revenue for 2017 was $807,412. Only $38,401 was spent on management. I just want to ask one last time, are you sure there is no amount you would like to donate today?

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.\n\tPersuadee: I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.\nPersuader: They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. \n\tPersuadee: Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  \nPersuader: Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. \n\tPersuadee: I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.\nPersuader: I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. \n\tPersuadee: It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?\nPersuader: It is a huge movement.

These kids really deserve it :)\n\tPersuadee: I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.\nPersuader: You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. \n\tPersuadee: Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?\nPersuader: Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.

I can let you in on some details and questions you may have.\n\tPersuadee: I would prefer to find a charity that assist either in the medical funding side of children's cancer or financial burden assistance to the families of children with cancer. I feel like we can have more of a direct impact on something. Do you know of any charities like that?\nPersuader: Unfortunately no. However, the charity does in fact help the children access basic necessities such as food and water to those impacted by natural disasters across the globe. So while not directly helping families financially they are relieving some burdens.\n\tPersuadee: Okay, I'm already familiar with Save the Children, I just typically have concerns on where the money actually goes with them. But how much are you thinking we should donate?\nPersuader: Any amount will do, however it'll be extracted from the task payment. I'd say .15 cents from both of us should be fair. Also my mistake earlier, Save the Children apparently has had a childhood cancer treatment going on for a few years now.\n\tPersuadee: Okay, I think .15 cents sounds fair. And good, that makes me feel a bit better. \nPersuader: Thanks for the consideration. Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\tPersuadee: Do you know how long the organization has been around?\nPersuader: Around the year 1919 near World War I, founded by Eglantyne Jebb in London.\n\tPersuadee: And do they have an estimated number of children they have helped?\nPersuader: 157 million children approximately, as well as 56 million children receiving direct help.\n\tPersuadee: How many countries?\nPersuader: 120 countries including the US. They've worked in Zambia, Zimbabwe, the Philippines, Lebanon, and Nicaragua just to name a few.\n\tPersuadee: Have you ever donated to them before?\nPersuader: Yes actually! In one my old school they held a fundraiser for donations for those affected by the hurricanes in Florida about a year ago.\n\tPersuadee: Oh nice! I don't know if I ever have directly, I can't really remember. \nPersuader: Good to know you support them at least!

When you have people who are so poor, it's amazing what a tiny amount can do.\n\tPersuadee: I would gladly give my earnings to this charity.  Children hold the future of the world.\nPersuader: It is really so heartbreaking when you see all of these kids not having enough to eat. It really breaks the heart.

It is so sad.\nPersuader: Even the little bit you donate from your earnings can go a long way to making a difference for a child. \n\tPersuadee: Though MTurk they should raise quite a bit.  Even though it is only .30 for this hit, with the number of people it adds up.\nPersuader: That's what happens. Even small amounts make such a big difference when they are added up. That's why it does make such a difference to even do small things. \n\tPersuadee: In my personal life I do pay attention to all the details and the reviews of charities.

And these small things just make such a difference. \n\tPersuadee: It is hard to watch and not reach out to help a child.  I do what I can in my own community and the town comes together this time of year to make sure each child has school supplies.  It is really sad that Save a Child exists, the world should be a safe place for children and there should be no need. \nPersuader: It should be. But with people helping it can at least make a difference. I think everyone can do their part. \n\tPersuadee: I agree, it has been very nice chatting with you and I hope you have a great day.\nPersuader: Thank you so much.

Donations that are giving to the company is strictly used to help the children with their needs. They are well known and trusted all over the world.\n\tPersuadee: Oh nice!

They are an outstanding organization thats what to see every child reach their dreams and live a full healthy life.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah, that's exactly it.

It's sad and it feels like sometimes there's nothing we can do about it.\nPersuader: I know that is how it feels but their is something we can do about it. We can donate to Save the Children. They are a professional orgization with international impact, it is a trustable fund that uses the money for its intended purposes. Even the smallest donation amount has an impact on an orginization like this one. For the same amount that gets spent in vending machienes at school/work, or the cost of a starbucks coffee, would really help Save the Children's charity. \n\tPersuadee: Wow.  I didn't know that about the small donations. I always thought only large donations help.\nPersuader: Never discount the small donations, they add up over time. Larger donations make a bigger impact (of course!) but not many people are able to donate such a big chunk at a time. If we were all able to donate our entire income to the charity at least once then we could begin to really Save the Children.
