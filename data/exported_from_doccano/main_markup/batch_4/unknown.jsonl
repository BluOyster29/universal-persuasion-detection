I feel pretty good about charities.\n\tPersuadee: I was hoping you would be willing to donate to the Children's Charity - it helps sick kids with their medical costs, helps the parents stay close to them at no cost.  Do you think you could donate $1000?\nPersuader: Wow! That is a lot. I have heard about all of the storms in Hawaii, and I know kids there need help. I am not sure I can give that much. How much are you willing to give?\n\tPersuadee: I plan to give about $100 and heard that a corporation would donate the same amount, so that would be great, wouldn't it? \nPersuader: Oh, that really would be great. I would be willing to donate. Can you take less than $1000?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, whatever you can afford would be absolutely amazing!!  All donations will be matched so it all adds up quickly. Would you be able to donate $500?\nPersuader: I think I could donate $500. Can you make your donation a little more, or not?\n\tPersuadee: You know what, it is really important to help the hurricane victims so I will be happy to dig a bit deeper and donate $500.\nPersuader: Oh thank you! I feel so bad about all of the children. They really are suffering. I know how hungry, and in need of medical attention they must be. I know I would be devastated if my own kids needed help. Or any of my family's kids. Do you have any kids in your family?\n\tPersuadee: I do have an adult child,and a grandson- so any childs need really tugs at me. And it looks like the Childrens Charity and the Hurricane Relief will help many kids, and their parents.  I am going to also add a go fund me on the internet  for the Children's Charity to try to raise more money. Is that something that you might do for Hawaii?\nPersuader: Yes, Save the Children has a great website. I am going to look into what else they do. Have you looked at their site?\n\tPersuadee: I plan to to do that! So we have agreed that we will give $500 each to our charities. I know that will be a huge help. I thank you so much for donating to such a great cause!\nPersuader: Yes. When you look at their site, you will see it is based in Ct, but they are doing great things all over. I feel really good about giving. How do you feel?\n\tPersuadee: I love helping anyone - especially in the US.  I am going to look into volunteering opportunities as well.  I would love to be a part of either charity. Do you actually volunteer with Save the Children?\nPersuader: I have not yet. Have you?\n\tPersuadee: No, but our donations will be a good start! Volunteering is something I want to do very soon.  Again, thank you so much for your most generous donation and time!", "label": []}

I think there is sometimes charities that are not as transparent about where the donations go. \nPersuader: so some charities steal and some do the gods work?\n\tPersuadee: I don't know that I would consider it stealing. I think that some charities use funds for things other than direct support. I think it is the donaters responsibility to research ahead of their donation\nPersuader: if they get couch what would be the sentence? \n\tPersuadee: If they got caught stealing from a charity? or if they just don't use the funds correctly. I think it would be two different things\nPersuader: the firs question, If they got caught stealing from a charity?\n\tPersuadee: If they got caught stealing from a charity they should go to jail. For how long depends on how much money they stole though\nPersuader: and if they dont manage the funds correctly ?\n\tPersuadee: I don't think there should be a legal punishment for that. That would result in them losing their position\nPersuader: you think that the money managing and where the money go must be transparent?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. If much of the donation goes to overhead costs, then people who are donating should be aware of that\nPersuader: did happen something recently about a charity fraud? \n\tPersuadee: Not that I am aware of. I have not heard anything about that\nPersuader: what was the most amount collected in a charity?\n\tPersuadee: The most amount ever? A lot - Paypal raised like 48 million online for charity a few years ago. But any long running charities that are successful probably far exceed that \nPersuader: last question, what is your impressions about save the children charity?\n\tPersuadee: I think they are a good organization that does important work ", "label": []}

If so, what kinds stand out to you?\n\tPersuadee: I dont really like to donate . Especially to anything big. If  I did though it would be to local animal shelters.  Animals are close to my heart\nPersuader: What do you mean by anything big? Wouldn't it be nice to donate toward something 'big' enough to help others in a meaningful way? I love animal causes though, and definitely agree.\n\tPersuadee: big as in they have a huge advertising budget  and ceos get huge money  like Susan G Komen and charities like that\nPersuader: That's always horrible. This childrens cause though is just from the university, all the proceeds go to them directly. I don't think it's about turning a profit, as much as it providing kids food, school supplies, safe homes, etc. To those in terrible situations who need it.\n\tPersuadee: That is sad.  Is it local ? I dont think 1 penny should go overseas when there is so much suffering here\nPersuader: I just looked that up for you - theyre actually headquartered in London, but they serve 120 countries around the world. This includes the US too\n\tPersuadee: Well thats good but if I were to donate to something it would have to be 100 %  USA  .. America First . Honestly though Id rather help animals\nPersuader: What are your thoughts when other countries pool efforts to help americans?\n\tPersuadee: When does that ever happen ?\nPersuader: After the 9/11 attacks, what is often overlooked is that many other countries donated toward the US to try and help. Even people in countries in the middle east and so on. I think its always really nice when people overlook any differences or distance to try and help others in need.\n\tPersuadee: Well that is nice but  those occurences  are rare. Like the president said  we have to put ourselves first because no other country will... Hence  America  First\nPersuader: I think if everyone thought like that, nobody would get helped. The only people who would be okay would be those born rich and advantaged.\n\tPersuadee: Well I think we have a big disagreement on how much other people help us . I think Houston, New Jersey, Hurricane Katrina  have taught us we have to depend on ourselves\nPersuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I will choose  $0  .

I've heard of poorly run charities that misuse the donations. Like only 50% of your donation actually helps children.

What are you trying to complete by speaking with me\nPersuader: I would like to ask if you would be willing to donate some or all of your incoming payment for this task to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: Im afraid not. I believe that parents of the child are responsible to take care of their children this is Gods way. If the parent is not there to complete this it is the Churches job. Now we have people that don't go to church because organizations and governments have started doing this.\nPersuader: There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. Save the Children does work to help these children in situations that they and their parents are unable to control.\n\tPersuadee: I understands that. But I do not take my money from my family and give it to another family. My family first. When I am doing surveys to make pennies I don't have money to give to other countries\nPersuader: How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I choose $0\nPersuader: Are you sure there is no amount that you would like to donate today?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I am positive\nPersuader: Save the Children is a large organization that has helped many already but relies on donations to continue their good work. How many more children have to suffer?\n\tPersuadee: As long as evil is in the world people that shouldn't suffer will. So wouldn't you say that money only mask the problem. ( Just as medication doesn't fix most diseases just mask symptoms). We need to fix the problem not mask it\nPersuader: Organizations such as Save the Children are trying to reduce some of the evil and suffering in the world by spreading help and relief. Even if it does not fix the problem, can't you say that is can help give a child a fighting chance to hopefully help end the cycle of evil?\n\tPersuadee: I would like to know how much the executives or (consultants) get paid to help this organizations efforts\nPersuader: In fiscal year 2017, 86% of all expenditures went to program services. 9% was used to promote fundraising. Only 5% of all expenditures were spent on Management.\n\tPersuadee: How much was made not percentages\nPersuader: The total operating revenue for 2017 was $807,412. Only $38,401 was spent on management. I just want to ask one last time, are you sure there is no amount you would like to donate today? ", "label": []}

They value children's education greatly which not only enhances the ability for these innocent children to learn skills that can be applied in the workforce, but it also gives them a safe and positive place to be which can't be guaranteed otherwise for some of them.\n\tPersuadee: I have not heard of Save the Children before.   Sounds like they really help education wise.\nPersuader: They do. But they also assist in other ways. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Hurricane Harvey that devastated part of South Texas but Save the Children is still assisting the affected children and families long after most organizations have washed their hands. \n\tPersuadee: Yes I have heard of Hurricane Harvey.  Oh so they do more than just help with education.  Thats awesome!!  \nPersuader: Yes, it really is. They also provide information on their website about how funding and donations are dispersed. 86% goes to program funding, 9% to Fundraising and 5% to Management. I like that they are transparent. It adds to their credibility. \n\tPersuadee: I really like how they show where the funding and donations are spent.  WIth some charity you never know just how much really goes to help the kids.\nPersuader: I couldn't agree more. For me, the transparency removes all doubt towards donating. \n\tPersuadee: It sure does.  ANything else I should know about this charity?\nPersuader: It is a huge movement.

These kids really deserve it :)\n\tPersuadee: I know they really deserve but I am kinda on a tight budget right now but go ahead and tell me about this unique opportunity.\nPersuader: You can choose anywhere from .01 to the full amount. Literally every penny helps these children. I understand being on a tight budget and needing the additional income. Just think, the impact the pennies would have on their lives is more than the impact pennies make in a more fortunate situation. \n\tPersuadee: Im not sure that I am so fortunate and every a penny saved is a penny earned, but I do see your point.   So how would I donate if I chose to do this today?  Do i pay online or how do I go about it?\nPersuader: Very true that every penny saved is a penny earned. In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I. The amount you choose to donate is automatically deducted today from your task payment. There's no paying online or entering payment info. It will be automatically processed for you by the requestor. :)\n\tPersuadee: Ok I will definitely make a donation today to Save the CHildren.  YOu have convinced me that this is a great, trustworthy charity to donate to.\nPersuader: You are AWESOME! How much of your payment would you like to donate today?

You could be a hero in a child's life by donating to Save the Children. \n\tPersuadee: I usually don't donate unless I do a little more research into an organization, but if all you said is correct, I think I must just donate. So am I allowed to contribute my HIT proceeds? It's only $0.30, but I guess it's better than nothing!\nPersuader: Absolutely!! Anything that you are able to donate would make a major difference in a child's life. Thank you so much for caring about the children that so many have forgotten!!\n\tPersuadee: No problem. Sorry, it isn't much but i guess there are worse ways to spend your money Friday night!\nPersuader: Your donation is plenty and will save a child! You are an amazing person! Welcome to the Save the Children family!!\n\tPersuadee: Thanks for introducing me to the charity. It sounds like a really good organization. So, do you have a link I need to follow to donate, or is that provided after the chat?\nPersuader: I don't see a link, so I am sure you will find one after the chat\n\tPersuadee: Okay, sounds good. I'll donate my hard earned $0.30 then! Thanks again and have a great weekend!\nPersuader: Thank you, from all the children!", "label": []}

{"id": 2352, "data": "Persuader: Hello! Thank you so much for taking time to talk to me today. How are you doing?\n\tPersuadee: Hi. I'm doing good. Thanks.  ANd you?\nPersuader: I'm doing okay, but I could be doing better.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah.  Same here to be honest.  I'm just glad the weekend is coming\nPersuader: I am very blessed to be able to enjoy my weekend, there are many people in this world who are not so fortunate to enjoy theirs. \n\tPersuadee: Yeah. You can say that again.  A lot of people don't even get them.  THey just work all the time.\nPersuader: I use to be one of those people. I feel bad for children who have little control of their situation and can't even enjoy their childhood.\n\tPersuadee: I agree. They are just born into difficult situations.  They don't have a say in it.  It's really sad.\nPersuader: Exactly! Have you heard of the Save the Children charity? Tehy provide Health resources, education, protection and emergency relief to children around the world.\n\tPersuadee: No. I haven't. But that's very interesting.  They're doing good work it seems\nPersuader: Yes, they are trying their best but there never seems to be enough. Children are still dieing of hunger and others are growing up in war zones constantly under attack. \n\tPersuadee: Yeah. I know. The numbers are really bad.  It's sad and it feels like sometimes there's nothing we can do about it.\nPersuader: I know that is how it feels but their is something we can do about it. We can donate to Save the Children. They are a professional orgization with international impact, it is a trustable fund that uses the money for its intended purposes. Even the smallest donation amount has an impact on an orginization like this one. For the same amount that gets spent in vending machienes at school/work, or the cost of a starbucks coffee, would really help Save the Children's charity. \n\tPersuadee: Wow.  I didn't know that about the small donations. I always thought only large donations help.\nPersuader: Never discount the small donations, they add up over time. Larger donations make a bigger impact (of course!) but not many people are able to donate such a big chunk at a time. If we were all able to donate our entire income to the charity at least once then we could begin to really Save the Children. Do you think you would be able to do that?\n\tPersuadee: If you think it will help, then yes I will.\nPersuader: You are truly an amazing person. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2)\n\tPersuadee: I will donate 25 cents today.\nPersuader: thank you so much for your donation today. The reasearch team will collect all donations and send them to Save the Children. Have a blessed weekend!\n\tPersuadee: Ok. Sounds good.  Thanks.  You too!!!", "label": []}

It's money that you never saw or had in your possession.\n\tPersuadee: What charity is this for?\nPersuader: This is for Save the Children, an international organization that benefits children in impoverished areas who otherwise wouldn't receive basic services that many of our children take for granted.\n\tPersuadee: How do the donations work or distributed?\nPersuader: You would specify how much of your $2 payment you are willing to donate to this great cause, and the researchers will pass it onto Save the Children instead of paying it to you.\n\tPersuadee: What part of the country or countries does this go too?\nPersuader: The money goes to Save the Children directly. While you can't know what country your money will specifically benefit, they have continuing programs in many impoverished and worn torn countries and well as in poverty stricken areas of the US.\n\tPersuadee: Ok, what are the donation minimums?\nPersuader: There is no minimum. Every penny counts. Though you may choose to donate $0, I hope you will consider the children in your decision.\n\tPersuadee: Ok, I will make a donation\nPersuader: Wonderful!
