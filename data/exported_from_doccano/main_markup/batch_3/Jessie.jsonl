Your donation would go directly to helping children receive food and education in locations where they are in desperate need of help. Would this be something you would be interested in?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, this sounds good. Is there a specific or minimum amount necessary?\nPersuader: That's great! Thank you!

What about you?\nPersuader: It think it is a terrible idea.\n\tPersuadee: Why do you think that?\nPersuader: Charity such as this does not actually pull people out of poverty.\n\tPersuadee: Well it does help somewhat. I don't think that anything will pull people completely out of poverty. It's a hand up.\nPersuader: It is good on a basic humanitarian level. The money could be far better spent in opening up their native countries to the global system of trade. The west has spent trillions in aid over the last 60 years in Africa and do not have anything to show for it.\n\tPersuadee: That is true. The poor are barely left to survive while the rich get richer. It's a sad truth.\nPersuader:  There is nothing morally wrong with the rich getting richer. In the last 10 years those rich people have invested in the global trade system and brought over a billion people out of the world poverty threshold. In the world there is an elite segment of the population that provides most of the value for society, they should be the ones with the lion share of the resources. This is because the only way they can obtain a large amount of wealth in the first place is to make hundreds, thousands, and millions of mutually beneficial transactions.\n\tPersuadee: That's a valid point. What do you think can help?\nPersuader: Greater free trade between countries and the ability for poor people to have access to sources of micro finance and capital goods so that many of them can invest in tools that make themselves more productive and cap dig their way out of poverty. \n\tPersuadee: That would be good for the world. There's no reason for us to not have free trade really.

Are you aware of the other things the organization does for kids? \n\tPersuadee: I've never really looked into it, could you give me some more information?\nPersuader: Yes! Besides the usual schooling and basic healthcare many of us are familiar with, Save the Children also assists communities during natural disasters such as earthquakes, they try to help communities with economic opportunities, and they event get involved with child intervention in area of war such as Syria or other parts of the world that are experiences in influx of refugees. \n\tPersuadee: You don't say. I'm getting really interested in donating from the information you gave me. What do you think would be a good starting donation?\nPersuader: That's fantastic!

You are the bomb!!!!\n\tPersuadee: Thank you for the infomation! You were a great help.\nPersuader: No, thank you!  The children and staff of Save the Children thank you too!  It's folks like you that will allow the organization to go another 100 years!  \n\tPersuadee: I hope so.

Don't you agree?\n\tPersuadee: That really is a shame. I was fortunate enough to grow up 10 minutes from a beach regardless of my financial situation, but so many kids have no means to even take public transportation to a beach if they wanted to. Very unfortunate. I always hope those kinds are able to make a better situation of their lives as they get older to make up those experiences.\nPersuader: I agree. We live near the beach right now too, and it's great. My kids are so fortunate to be living a life so far removed from war zones like kids in Syria. And, to have their basic needs met to be able to enjoy their childhood.

My biggest concerns with organizations like that is there isn't a ton of transparency as to where donation funds actually go.\nPersuader: Oh, I totally understand. I feel like most of those organizations take the money and run. Save the Children actually has 86% of the money that is donated directly helping the children. It's listed on Forbes list of top 50 charities. \n\tPersuadee: Wow, that's great. I consider Forbes pretty trustworthy. I appreciate you getting that info for me. I'll have to dig further into their mission statements and activities. Some of that stuff can get so political!\nPersuader: They also have their annual financial report actually listed on their website which I think is pretty impressive for a charity organization. Would you consider donating part of your pay for this task to Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: I would, but I think I'd have to review all of their documentation first and then possibly even donate on my own time! That's not to say I'm uninterested, I just like to trust and verify.\nPersuader: I understand. It's important to do research before giving money to organizations. This one just seems like they're doing a lot of great work helping children in the U.S. and abroad. And, it would be so easy to have your payment taken directly from your task payment.\n\tPersuadee: 100% agreed. I'll have to dig into their information and make a decision. Have you donated to them before or do you plan to?\nPersuader: I haven't in the past, but after reading more about them I definitely plan to. Their credentials are outstanding. And, I like that so much of their proceeds actually go to help. I've seen some awful numbers from organizations like Goodwill who claim to be helping but all of their money actually goes to their CEO's.\n\tPersuadee: You think Goodwill is bad, look at some of the reports on Susan G Komen--BREAST CANCER of all things. What starts with a good intention doesn't always end up that way. Does Save The Children specifically aim to help Syrian chidren?\nPersuader: Oh, really? I haven't heard about Susan G Komen being so bad, I will have to look into that. I did a race of theirs about 10 years ago. \n\tPersuadee: I can\\'t speak for 10 years ago, but I know recently they were found out to have so much of their money going to \"marketing\" that a massive portion of their proceeds never even made it to research.

That's why I'm pleasantly surprised to see that Save the Children has such a high percentage of donations being used. And, no. They don't only help in Syria. They support kids all over the world by helping them get healthcare, education, making sure their safe, etc. I'm going to donate part of my proceeds.

Kids are so expensive!\n\tPersuadee: yes! very true \nPersuader: Have you ever heard of Save the Children? They have a lot of ads on daytime TV.\n\tPersuadee: no, i dont have cable \nPersuader: Ah.  That's probably just as well.  They're an organization that has been around forever and does a lot of work with children in impoverished and war-torn countries. I've never donated myself, but we're going to have an opportunity to donate some of our earnings as part of this exercise.\n\tPersuadee: Interesting, Do you believe that these children actually get help from this charities? Because I hope so, but not sure.\nPersuader: Yeah, I always wonder about that myself. I think that with Save the Children, they've been around long enough and have a good enough reputation that I trust them. I have to say, I was on their website and saw what they're doing for kids in Syria.  I didn't know that over 1000 children have been killed or injured there as part of the violence.  It just breaks my heart.  As hard as things were for me, raising my daughter as a single mom, at least we didn't have to worry about getting shot.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, that is very true! Very heartbreaking stuff goes on around this world. Like you said we are very blessed to not have to always worry about bombs being dropped on top of us. \nPersuader: There was that whole poison gas thing there, too.  Do you think you'd be willing to give part of your payment for this task to help deal with that? After all, it's just a little bit of money that we've earned just sitting here chatting.\n\tPersuadee: yes, i think i may. how about you?\nPersuader: Yeah.  I guess I'd feel kind of guilty if I didn't. How much would you be willing to give? I think we can choose any amount from $0 to all of our payment.\n\tPersuadee: I dont know, but i would def feel guilty too if i didnt after this chat we just had\nPersuader: Haha.  Me too.  I guess I'm going to say that I'll donate the whole thing. It's not like I'm going to come up with anything better to do with whatever little bit of money we make from this.

Pretty much what they do is use donations from charitable, and caring citizens to help children around the world get on a better path to the future.\n\tPersuadee: Oh. Well I think that the donations that go there are supporting a good cause. Especially for hungry children without food and water\nPersuader: So true. On top of that, they have full financial disclosure of their donations. About 86% goes to program services for less-fortunate kids, and the 14% goes to Fundraising and Management (Personally, I'd like to the latter number go down in the future).\n\tPersuadee: Do you think too many people are donating to their charity? Why say that when they are being helped?\nPersuader: Not exactly. Just like any charity, they need to get money for operating costs, so not every single cent goes to the children unfortunatley. But 86% is a lot compared to other organizations.\n\tPersuadee: Ah i see. So like for administration. I just read an article saying that not all donations are going to the right children; specifically to the less unfortunate. Would you ever consider donating to them knowing these facts?\nPersuader: It depends to be honest. You've got to understand that the organization needs money to stay operating, or else they would fail and no children would be helped. Make sense?\n\tPersuadee: I understand that. I don't disagree with anything they do since children are being helped\nPersuader: That's true, have you donated to a charity before?\n\tPersuadee: no not that i remember of\nPersuader: I didn\\'t before either, but recently I\\'ve been giving little bits here and there when I can. I think of it like... \"What would make me happier? A $1 cup of coffee or using that $1 to help someone in need.\" It truly is a rewarding experience.\n\tPersuadee: hmm I'd love to donate if I was in a financially secure, but at the moment I don't think I can even spare a dollar. I do support all the donations going to the charity though.\nPersuader: Trust me, I understand haha. I'm in the same situation. But if you had the opportunity now to donate a $1 to Save the Children, you wouldn't? It'd be deducted from the task payment today. If that's too much even $0.50 will help out the children that really need.

So, to be fair, I'll let you decide the amount of today's payment (0-$2) that gets donated, since you'll be the one making a difference.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah. I'll go ahead and go with $0.50. Every penny counts. In the future, I would like to donate much more, its one of the promises I've made to myself\nPersuader: That's awesome! We need more people like you. Would you like me to provide you with some more information about Save The Children (just the link)? That way, when we both have a little extra money, years and years in the future, we can hope to help out more children\n\tPersuadee: not a problem. I'd appreciate it.\nPersuader:  URL .

Are you someone who has ever donated to a charity or offered your time for a charitable cause?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I have done both.\nPersuader: I'm glad to hear that. Charity is very important. Can I ask what kind of organizations you have donated to?\n\tPersuadee: A variety ... mostly health related causes.\nPersuader: Those are very good causes. Have you ever heard of the organization Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes but I don't know much about it. \nPersuader: Save the Children Promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries. They work in the US and internationally. \n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a very worthy cause.\nPersuader: It is. More impressively, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so donations are used for the cause rather than allocated to profits. \n\tPersuadee: That is pretty impressive but I would rather see more than 90 percent of donations go directly to helping the children.\nPersuader: I can understand that. But given that it is an international organization, there is overhead that must be paid for such as travel. This organization is especially helpful in countries where there is a lack of support for children in war zones such as Syria. \n\tPersuadee: I know international travel is expensive but having 14 percent of the donations going to overhead seems a bit high to me.  It should be no more than 10 percent max.\nPersuader: I understand. But many organization are too scared to go into countries like Syria where children are facing extreme violence. In the first 2 months alone, 1,000 children were killed or injured there. Save the Children does help in this country and others like it. \n\tPersuadee: I can understand that but I have seen too many examples of charities where the money is not spent wisely.\nPersuader: I can see your concern, but please know that this is a very worthy cause. How much do you like to donate to the charity now? Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to all your payment ($2).\n\tPersuadee: I would say 40 cents\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your generosity.

I know how hard it can be to give, but it's amazing how a small amount can make such a big difference\n\tPersuadee: That is very true.

Would you like to know what their donations go toward?\n\tPersuadee: Yes. I would like to know what the donations go to.\nPersuader: Donating to this cause would pay for their education, healthcare, disaster relief, hunger, and protection. The protection factor is important to me, it helps to prevent abuse, neglect, violence and exploitation of innocent children. \n\tPersuadee: Oh that sounds excellent! Do you know what percentage of the donations actually goes to help the children?\nPersuader: I believe 100 percent of the donations go to the children. I should do some more research on this because that is a very important question.\n\tPersuadee: I am sure not a 100% goes to the children they would probably keep some for fundraising and spreading the word like a lot of other charities do but the percentage is important. Some charities don't even send 50% of donations to the actual cause.\nPersuader: That is true, you bring up a valid point.

I agree. if there isn't coverage then people tend put it out of their minds. but this group sounds great!

Not only in this country but in developing countries.  The hunger rates for children in some developing countries is just staggering.\n\tPersuadee: Yeah its terrible to think about all the kids who go hungry around the world.  not even having clean water is something I cant even fathom and they have to deal with that every day.\nPersuader: I know!

I'm they are similar to some of the other humanitarian relief organizations out there though.\nPersuader: Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.  They have been the world leader in  it for over 100 years.  \n\tPersuadee: Sounds like a well meaning group, ill have to do some research and learn more about their work.\nPersuader: You can check out their website  URL   Your donation today can really help.  And it is put to work immediately.  Especially seeing as how millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence\n\tPersuadee: Unfortunatly I wont be donating anything today.

Would you rather not round it up to a dollar instead?\n\tPersuadee: I might consider. But for now I am thinking about donating 0.50 cents as my donation to them.\nPersuader: I see. Donating 1 dollar would help feed twice as many children as 50 cents would.\n\tPersuadee: how about if I do 0.75 cents.

Parts of this world are so dark...how can we sit here and do nothing?\n\tPersuadee: Do nothing about what?\nPersuader: These poor suffering children! Did you know that 5.6 million children die each year due to treatable AND preventable diseases?\n\tPersuadee: That's awful. Are you talking about around the world or in the states? \nPersuader: Around the world! There is so much that could be done..between preventing the spread of aids, reducing the infant mortality rate with proper education and vaccinations, and ensuring access and aid to proper nutrition so many children could be saved.\n\tPersuadee: I totally agree. There are people helping but its a drop in the bucket. The kids dying is really disturbing. They didn't choose that life. \nPersuader: You are absolutely right. It is disturbing! And yes, it could seem like the aid is a drop in a bucket. However, if we can move the scale one iota and can consider that what that represents is one child having a week of meals or a healthy 3 months than wouldn't you agree that that would be worth any aid that we could provide?\n\tPersuadee: Absolutely! I think every little bit helps but as a whole it's not enough. Have you ever donated? \nPersuader: I have! And it feels incredible knowing that I have been a part of something greater than myself. It really helps you shift your perspective about your own personal significance on this planet. You realize how infinitely important you are and yet at the same time how infinitely important another person is. When you have the ability to literally change another person's life with something so small...wow, it's life changing.\n\tPersuadee: That is great! you sound very passionate about this subject. I should do more to help.\nPersuader: You should! and you can! I recently have become acquainted with a charity that is actually doing everything we have discussed and is seeing some real results! They have managed to single handedly reduce the infant mortality rate by 62 percent, can you believe that?\n\tPersuadee: That is an incredible figure!!! 62% is amazing. What is the charity? I may consider a donation.\nPersuader: The charity is called Save the Children! Pretty spot on with the name, right? What's really fascinating is that you can actually directly contribute your reward for this task directly to that charity. Pretty convenient.\n\tPersuadee: That is convenient!!! I will definitely do that. At least a portion of it. \nPersuader: Incredible! I'm so glad we can partner to provide some more light to this ever darkening world.

It's definitely challenging when confronted with the reality of giving of ourselves as opposed to the hypothetical. But I would suggest that you make the leap. In reality, all this would cost is the time you've spent hear. But oh buddy, think about what you would gain? The peace of mind that comes with knowing that a baby girl in Uganda gets to live for another year or a little boy in Syria gets fed when he didn't think he would have another meal this week. \n\tPersuadee: I hear ya! I will donate I'm just not sure how much.\nPersuader: Let your heart guide you! I'm really pleased to hear that. Thanks for having an open mind and doing what's right.

I was amazed to see that over 86 percent goes into their programs. Only 5% is for management and 9% to fundraising.\n\tPersuadee: Those are good numbers, shows that most of the money goes to the kids and not big salaries.\nPersuader: 44 percent alone goes to health, nutrition, and hunger. In 2017 alone, they reached 155million children. 237K in the U.S\n\tPersuadee: That's fantastic, they've helped a lot!\nPersuader: And sadly, there is still so much more to do. In just one area, Syria, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. n the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured!\n\tPersuadee: I would be afraid aid meant to be given to the children would be seized by those in power and never reach the kids.\nPersuader: I had wondered about that myself. They work closely with the U.N  and other organizations in the local area to be sure it gets to those in need and not the aggressors. \n\tPersuadee: Hopefully those organizations aren't as corrupt as has been reported in the media.  You just don't know what to believe any more.\nPersuader: That is true. This one seems to have been around for awhile and seems to be highly rated though. Have you ever had a chance to donate to Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, years ago I remember a presentation and we did donate then.  I have since been donating to local animal rescue groups.  They really need the help.\nPersuader: Yeah, I have donated little amounts here and there as I can. Though the shelters everywhere seem to need help as well! I give little bits when I can. Would you be interested in giving a small donation??\n\tPersuadee: I would definitely consider it.\nPersuader: Any little bit helps any of these organizations.

There's always someone out there who has it worse than I do by far and if $1 helps it will make me feel good to help even just a little.\n\tPersuadee: True, true, that makes sense. I guess I'm more pragmatic. Sure, there are people out there who have it relatively worse than us, but it's still a struggle, and I can't justify giving up half my earnings. I mean, for me, this is my side income (Mturk). Anyway, hope we're close to 10 chats\nPersuader: We finally did the 10 chats! Thanks for your donation! Every little bit does help.

I read that if we finish like 10 responses to each other, the task can be considered a success. I\\'m 33 y/o, by the way. It\\'s so cool considering that my husband and I only tried getting pregnant in just 2 months after our wedding.

Well, your boyfriend\\'s right at some point. It is pretty expensive to have a child these days, anyway.

I\\'d understand if you don\\'t want to talk about it \nPersuader: Well I dont want to have children I prefer adopting one or two. And he is okay with that decision.

I just looked up their website and I didn't know they were helping a LOT of children all over the world. It's nice to hear/read stories of hope especially for our younger generation. I know you'd agree with me when I say being a child nowadays is tougher than our time. So much cyber-bullying, etc. Anyway, back to Save the Children, I think they're doing a pretty good job and would read more about them and their advocacies\nPersuader: I blame technology! lol Save the Children is an amazing charity because it really helps people in need. I also went to their websites and read couple of things\n\tPersuadee: True! Anyways, this has been an eye-opening task.

That's kind of why I'm confused.\nPersuader: It is confusing.\n\tPersuadee: Do we have to wait the full ten minutes? This robot's committed to donating. \nPersuader: 10 Chat turns I believe. Here is an example of one of my instructions to get you to donate: \"Use guilt appeal: You can persuade by making your partner guilty. You can ask how much money do they spend on unnecessary stuff like a bag of snack or candyÿ and remind them that money can be used in more meaningful ways. Small donations will indeed help a lot of children and their families. Convince your partner they are a part of the solution and they have the moral responsibility to help.\"\n\tPersuadee: Hahaha that's a good one. But unfortunately not necessary. Do you think people really put up arguments in here?\nPersuader: Honestly I have no idea.\n\tPersuadee: If there\\'s one after this maybe I will just to spice things up. Mine just says \"Welcome to the communication task. You will now start a conversation with your partner about a children's charity. Please don't game the task by replying short and meaningless sentences.\"\nPersuader: Have a nice day!", "label": [[10, 61, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [62, 126, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [126, 181, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [306, 328, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [328, 405, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [464, 632, "5-AUTHORITY-SUPERIOR"], [693, 742, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [743, 762, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [799, 809, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [810, 838, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [904, 925, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [926, 999, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1120, 1178, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1179, 1185, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1266, 1282, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [1384, 1408, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1770, 1872, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1699, 1769, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1543, 1698, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1476, 1542, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1409, 1476, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2008, 2032, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2325, 2341, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"]], "idx": "282"}
