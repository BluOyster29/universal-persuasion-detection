Is that the organization that provides food for kids around the world?\nPersuader: Correct, With a primary focus on those in troubled nations (such as war zones or poorly developed nations). If you would like to help, a donation from you could help save the thousands of children that deal with violence and hunger as a daily part of their lives.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Do you provide other things besides food?\nPersuader: Of course, one of our focus points is to provide health care, education, and safety to these children to help give them a way out of their troubled lives. And your small donation can go a long way, something as small as the price of a candy bar can be the difference in these kids lives.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Oh wow, that's a lot. what percent of my donation goes directly to the kids?\nPersuader: In 2017 86% of all fund raise went directly to the children in need, and of the 86%, 34% was directly put into providing food and nutrition.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: And the other percent that didn't go to food went to what? \nPersuader: Education, Emergency Relief, HIV/Aids treatment, and helping the children stay in a safe environment. I know its easy to ignore these children because they are half way around the world, but they need your help. Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable and treatable causes. Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of children and a lifetime of poor health. All it takes is an easy donation from you to help these children\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Which countries are being helped right now? \nPersuader: Much of the focus right now goes to war torn countries like Syria, but your donation would also go to help those who were hurt by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Maria in the Gulf of Mexico \n\t\t\tPersuadee: Texas, that's interesting. A lot of people lost homes and belongings in Harvey. It would be nice to help them.\nPersuader: So, How much do you like to donate to the charity now?\n\t\t\tPersuadee: I don't have a lot to give\nPersuader: Thats okay, a donation as little as 77 cents can house a refugee family for a day.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: OK 77 cents sounds good\nPersuader: Awesome, The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: great, I'm glad to help.", "label": [[11, 34, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [80, 87, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [89, 130, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [135, 237, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [343, 450, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [451, 606, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [674, 828, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [829, 871, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [872, 961, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1064, 1204, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [1290, 1391, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1392, 1501, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1502, 1584, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1585, 1666, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1802, 1999, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1667, 1731, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2137, 2191, "3-EMOTION-ALTERCASTING"], [2244, 2326, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2256, 2326, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [2376, 2463, "8-NO-PERSUASION"]], "idx": "322"}

Life is hard. It's unfortunate that some people have to live under the rule of extremely corrupt governments. It's also unfortunate that a semester of university in the US should be $700 adjusted for inflation from 1975 but instead it's  tens of thousands of dollars.

Don't worry about the amount, that one dollar can help a lot!\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Is there any other charities you've donated to in the past that you're passionate about?\nPersuader: I also really like the Ronald McDonald House system. Do you have any charities your passionate about?\n\t\t\tPersuadee: I haven't donated to them before, but I'm interested in helping the World Wildlife Fund\nPersuader: I've heard of them but I'm not sure what sure what they do.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: It's basically the leading organization in wildlife conservation and endangered species\nPersuader: That sounds awesome! I am passionate about that so I will definitely look into them! \n\t\t\tPersuadee: Yeah I always enjoy helping animals if I can!\nPersuader: Same here! It's so sad that some species are in so much trouble.", "label": [[122, 180, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [578, 598, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [669, 682, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [728, 750, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1062, 1114, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1471, 1534, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"], [1618, 1671, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [11, 33, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [92, 121, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [244, 344, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [449, 514, "5-AUTHORITY-OTHER"], [461, 514, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [683, 727, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [850, 885, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [886, 947, "2-NEGOTIATE-OTHER"], [1115, 1163, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1277, 1336, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1450, 1470, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1607, 1617, "1-RAPPORT-SIMILAR"]], "idx": "708"}
{"id": 1084, "data": "Persuader: Have you heard of the charity Save the Children?\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Yes I have, but I don't know a lot about it.\nPersuader: They promote children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: That sounds like a very nice cause.\nPersuader: Yes, it\\'s a great cause.  And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.  Including an \"A\" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.  \n\t\t\tPersuadee: That's awesome! Do you know when the charity began?\nPersuader: It was founded way back on April 15, 1919! A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.  Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!\n\t\t\tPersuadee: That is very impressive. Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?\nPersuader: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: That is awesome.\nPersuader: I know I was surprised by those numbers.  A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.\nPersuader: That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.\nPersuader: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.\nPersuader: Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.\nPersuader: That is so special.  That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.  How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?  You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.  You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.  I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.\n\t\t\tPersuadee: Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is awesome!  Nice move.  That's some good karma for you right there, and knowledge that your money is going to help children around the world.
