It's easy to donate when you feel attached to the situation, but helping someone you don't know takes a really special kind of person.\n\tPersuadee: yes, plus your making a difference in other peoples lives or animals. it is gods work.\nPersuader: I agree! Have you ever volunteered your time for a charity?\n\tPersuadee: I have made donations to the charity, but I have never volunteered for one.\nPersuader: We're all so busy or sometimes it's hard to get out to help so donating is a really good way to be able to help.

Do you think you could give a little more?\n\tPersuadee: i was thinking 0.30 as the amount I want to give. but I could up to to 0.50 cents\nPersuader: That's great.

Sounds like good meaningful work for a good cause.\nPersuader: It's so meaningful! Right now we are preparing a large shipment of supplies for Puerto Rico. There are families that we are in close contact with who have lost their children in the hurricane. More and more families are coming out of the woodwork, and we are becoming short on funds to help them. All I am asking is for the possibility of you to make a kind donation of two dollars so that we can ship more supplies to devastated families in Puerto Rico\n\tPersuadee: I do feel sorry for the american citizens in Puerto Rico that have been ignored by our government. I want to help, but I would rather just donate 1 dollar because to be frank I don't know much about the Save the Children organization. \nPersuader: We would really appreciate that. Right now, we are an international organization that has helped over 250,000 children in developing countries. We are based in the United States, and all of the people who participate in this organization have a background involving children (mainly teachers and parents). With donations, we are projected to help over 750,000 children in the next three years.\n\tPersuadee: I'll donate 1 dollar.

It's surprising how $100 can go so far within this organization.\n\tPersuadee: I'm disappointed that the government isn't helping puerto rico like it did with katrina or any other disaster\nPersuader: I completely understand, especially because they are our territory.

And the charity is highly rated with many positive rewards.  Including an \"A\" rating from the American Institute of Philanthropy.  \n\tPersuadee: That's awesome! Do you know when the charity began?\nPersuader: It was founded way back on April 15, 1919! A charity with that kind of history shows that it has made an amazing impact.  Just last year they helped a total of 155 million children!\n\tPersuadee: That is very impressive. Do you know on average how much money the charity makes per year?\nPersuader: The total operating revenue was $807,412 in 2017, and 9 out of every 10  dollars they make goes straight into the programs and services to help children and families in need.\n\tPersuadee: That is awesome.\nPersuader: I know I was surprised by those numbers.  A lot of widely known charities aren't as open and honest about where their finances go, but you can easily find Save the Children's financial reports online.  That's important to me in a charity.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, definitely. Unfortunately some \"charities\" are just scams that do not donate to a worthy cause at all.\nPersuader: That's the truth.  That's why it's so important to do research before donating.  Save the Children even breaks down where exactly your money goes on their website.  For example, 34% of the money donated goes to health & nutrition services and programs, 21% to education, 11% to emergencies, 11% to HIV/AIDs, etc.  It is fully listed on the site with an easy to read graphic.  Super helpful.\n\tPersuadee: That's very helpful. It is best to be transparent when running a charity like that, especially when the charity brings in a large amount of money. That way nobody can question anything.\nPersuader: Oh yeah.  When I first heard about these super well known organizations only actually using about 5% of their proceeds for their services I was shocked.  Save the Children uses a total of 86% of proceeds for their services and programs! The rest goes to \"fundraising, management, and general\" as the website says.  That\\'s good to hear that it\\'s not all about filling some people\\'s pockets.\n\tPersuadee: Right. I understand that people have to get paid for what they do, but they shouldn't be making an extravagant amount of money.\nPersuader: Exactly.  It's pretty infuriating to know that some people play on people's sensitivities and vulnerable states to just get rich.  I know when I make donations I always be sure to get the facts first now.  Have you ever donated to charity in the past?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I have. I usually like to donate to Johns Hopkins Hospital because that is where I had many of my surgeries when I was a child. The people there saved my life on more than one occasion and it's just a great hospital.\nPersuader: That is so special.  That must be an amazing feeling to be able to give back.  How do you feel about donating to Save the Children?  You can choose an amount that would be taken out automatically from your reward from this task.  You can pick any amount from $0 to $2.  I know that any small donation counts, because the more individuals donate the more impact they can make.\n\tPersuadee: Sure, I'd be glad to donate $0.25 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is awesome!

Is that the organization that provides food for kids around the world?\nPersuader: Correct, With a primary focus on those in troubled nations (such as war zones or poorly developed nations). If you would like to help, a donation from you could help save the thousands of children that deal with violence and hunger as a daily part of their lives.\n\tPersuadee: Do you provide other things besides food?\nPersuader: Of course, one of our focus points is to provide health care, education, and safety to these children to help give them a way out of their troubled lives. And your small donation can go a long way, something as small as the price of a candy bar can be the difference in these kids lives.\n\tPersuadee: Oh wow, that's a lot. what percent of my donation goes directly to the kids?\nPersuader: In 2017 86% of all fund raise went directly to the children in need, and of the 86%, 34% was directly put into providing food and nutrition.\n\tPersuadee: And the other percent that didn't go to food went to what? \nPersuader: Education, Emergency Relief, HIV/Aids treatment, and helping the children stay in a safe environment. I know its easy to ignore these children because they are half way around the world, but they need your help. Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable and treatable causes. Malnutrition contributes to the deaths of children and a lifetime of poor health. All it takes is an easy donation from you to help these children\n\tPersuadee: Which countries are being helped right now? \nPersuader: Much of the focus right now goes to war torn countries like Syria, but your donation would also go to help those who were hurt by Hurricane Harvey in Texas and Hurricane Maria in the Gulf of Mexico \n\tPersuadee: Texas, that's interesting. A lot of people lost homes and belongings in Harvey. It would be nice to help them.\nPersuader: So, How much do you like to donate to the charity now?\n\tPersuadee: I don't have a lot to give\nPersuader: Thats okay, a donation as little as 77 cents can house a refugee family for a day.\n\tPersuadee: OK 77 cents sounds good\nPersuader: Awesome, The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: great, I'm glad to help.", "label": [[11, 16, "Conventional-Opening"], [17, 34, "YesNo-Question"], [78, 86, "Acknowledge"], [87, 235, "Statement"], [338, 446, "Affirmative-Answer"], [446, 602, "Statement"], [668, 822, "Affirmative-Answer"], [823, 955, "Statement"], [1055, 1196, "Other-Answer"], [1280, 1381, "Other-Answer"], [1382, 1491, "Statement"], [1492, 1574, "Statement"], [1575, 1656, "Statement"], [1657, 1721, "Statement"], [1790, 1988, "Other-Answer"], [2123, 2177, "WH-Question"], [2228, 2239, "Acknowledge"], [2240, 2310, "Statement"], [2358, 2366, "Acknowledge"], [2367, 2445, "Statement"]], "idx": 779}

I was going to make a plea and ask if you would be willing to donate to Save the Children. It helps kids in need. I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help. Can you donate part of today's pay? Even a bit?\n\tPersuadee: It's so sad to me that anyone should go without food in our modern world.  So I would definitely be willing to help.  \nPersuader: Yes, I agree, it is sad. That is great that you can help! How much of today's pay can you give? Also, please include the $ sign with your pledge. Thank you!\n\tPersuadee: I think the bonus of today is 2 dollars so maybe if we both give half of it?  That is at least something.  I only wish that our Government would help the poor more than they do.  What do you think? \nPersuader: I would love to help as well. Can you pledge with the $ sign in your next reply. Also, I agree, the gov't should do more. And thanks for asking me too.\n\tPersuadee: So lets agree we both can give $1 of of bonus. \nPersuader: I would say that is a wonderful idea.

I could not imagine having to watch any child suffer, much less my own. Have you visited the Save the Children website?\n\tPersuadee: I have not visited the site but I have heard of them before.  I am one of those people who cant watch the commercials of the suffering kids or pets.  It really upsets me \nPersuader: I looked at the site. Have you heard about the recent storms/flooding in Hawaii?\n\tPersuadee: A little bit but not much.  I have been following politics and things are going crazy.  I am hoping that things will change soon. \nPersuader: Well, it looks like the STC is already to help the children there. I am amazed by their swift response. Isn't it really great!\n\tPersuadee: That is great that they are there helping.  Maybe they learned something from the mess in Puerto Rico.  The conditions there were really bad but the US gov really dropped the ball on helping. \nPersuader: Yes, I am sure that is it. I have to thank you again for your $1 donation. It will go to great use I am sure. Do you have any questions about the charity?\n\tPersuadee: Not really.

Just enjoying the sunny day and trying to help out a charity I am working on, Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: I wish I had some sun. Please tell me more about this charity\nPersuader: This charity is n international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. I have recently donated some money to it.   Would you be interested in how much I donated?\n\tPersuadee: Yes please. And also, was the donation mandatory or voluntary?\nPersuader: I donate about $15 a month and it is all voluntary.  I rather put my money into this charity then church offering because I know it directly helps children.  Would you like to know how I know it helps?\n\tPersuadee: That sounds like a reasonable amount. Sure, tell me more about how it's used\nPersuader: A year ago, I saw kid begging on the street who look really hungry.   I was about to give him some money until a representative for \"Save the Children\" walked ahead of me and help this kid out.   This person took them to their facility and provided food, shelter, and clothing.   A month later I saw the kid was healthier, happy, and cleaner.  I was so impress I decided to make a donation.   Would you be interested in a donation?\n\tPersuadee: Wow. Nice story. I'm very particular about who I donate to so I'd need more information\nPersuader: Understand.   \n\tPersuadee: About how many people a month does the charity help?\nPersuader: Since it is international it helps more then 1000's of kids per month.\n\tPersuadee: And is there a minimum amount required per month (like on of those sponsor a kid charities) or can it be just a one time donation?\nPersuader: No minimum, can be a one time donation.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds doable. Do you know by any chance if this is a registered charity? I want to make sure not all the money is going to the staff via salaries\nPersuader: Its non-governmental but is register to for tax purposes.   Only about 25% goes to the management/staff of the charity.\n\tPersuadee: Okay, that's good to know. I'll make a $20 donation today and keep researching this charity. If it checks out like you say, then I'll consider upping any future donations\nPersuader: This is great.  Thank you for your donation. \n\tPersuadee: No problem.

My day has been busy visiting different places to speak about the charity I support. Have you heard of Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: It sounds familiar to me, could you tell me more about it?\nPersuader: Helping children in countries that are very war torn or in some form of conflict is what we help in. Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need\n\tPersuadee: The charity sounds like it is doing some good work in an area that badly needs it. Children should be our top priority all across the world. How can someone get involved and help out with this charity?\nPersuader: Oh there are quiet a few ways. For roughly a dollar a day you can sponsor a child, you can choose a gift to spend to a child through our catalog, you could start a fundraiser, or you can just simply donate. With that, keep in mind if you ever decide to make a monetary donation, 86% goes directly to the children, 9% fundraising, and 5% management and general. Just so you can have an idea that we use 9 out of 10 dollars directly on the children.\n\tPersuadee: I do believe I would like to donate some money to the Save the Children charity. Could I pledge $1/day to start with?\nPersuader: absolutely thank you so much!!\n\tPersuadee: I like to donate money and time to charities that help children so I also want to thank you for educating me on this charity!\nPersuader: Absolutely. I love getting the word out there on this charity. I strongly believe in it and its values on helping children. Children should be a priority in the world. They are our future.\n\tPersuadee: They are our future exactly. Any time I can help improve a situation for a child in need I hope to be able to do so. How long have you been supporting this charity?\nPersuader: I have been supporting this charity for 15 years. I also must clarify with you about your donation, if you so choose too. Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment today. You can choose as little as $0 all the way up to all of your payment. That being said, would you still like to donate $1 to the Save the Children charity, starting to make a difference in a childs life?\n\tPersuadee: I would like to start making a difference today. I would want to still donate $1 to the Save the Children charity.\nPersuader: Thank you! That makes my heart so happy. Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria? Just know that your donation today, and hopefully the start of more to come, will help children like this.\n\tPersuadee: I hate hearing about children being subjected to violence. It hurts my heart. I do hope I can help and that my small donation does some good for a child.\nPersuader: Every penny counts!!\n\tPersuadee: Well that sounds just great to me!\nPersuader: Thank you once again for your donation and feel free to spread the word about the charity to others!\n\tPersuadee: You are welcome and thank you for bringing my attention to such a well deserved charity!

You can choose any of your $2 bonus to Save the Children. The research team will collect all donations and send them. Would you be willing to donate a portion of your bonus?\n\tPersuadee: Can you tell me, is Save the Children a charity that gives to children here in the USA?\nPersuader: Save the Children is a professional organization that gives to children all over the world. Children in the USA need to be saved, but children overseas also need assistance! \n\tPersuadee: Yes they do but I am very concerned that we are not giving enough to charities here in the USA.

I agree completely. I think there are a lot of people out there who need help, in so many different ways. Children, adults, and elderly.\n\tPersuadee: Veterans too.  It is so sad to drive down to the city and see so many homeless.  I have been reading on the news about my hometown and how the homeless are camped on the town common\nPersuader: That is very sad. I wish I could do more to help homeless people and veterans myself. It is hard to see people living in such sad conditions in this country that is supposed to be the land of opportunity. \n\tPersuadee: I totally agree.  I am just so upset daily about the division that has happened over the last 20 years\nPersuader: I hope that things improve. I am curious to see what the next 20 years hold.

{"id": 3423, "data": "Persuader: Hi, have you ever heard of the charity \"Save the Children\" before?\n\tPersuadee: No I havent, please tell me more.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world  \n\tPersuadee: That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.\nPersuader: Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that\n\tPersuadee: So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?\nPersuader: Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  \n\tPersuadee: I feel so silly! Is \"Save the Children\" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching\nPersuader: Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.\n\tPersuadee: Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough\nPersuader: Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.\n\tPersuadee: Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?\nPersuader:  URL here you go\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?\nPersuader: I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club\n\tPersuadee: oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.\nPersuader: Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.\nPersuader: I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. \n\tPersuadee: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me, I will definitely look more into this charity!\nPersuader: Great happy to help!

The lack of child support in developing countries, such as in Syria, has been growing for years now.\n\tPersuadee: Does this organization help people in the USA?\nPersuader: No, they assist children in war zones. In Syria, in 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reported to be killed of injured due to rising violence.\n\tPersuadee: How much of the proceeds go directly towards the children?\nPersuader: For every dollar donated, they receive 77 cents. It's a higher rate than most charities, because while we want most of the money to go to the children, there also needs to be some paid employees, although most are volunteers. Would you be interested in saving a child's life today?\n\tPersuadee: No, thank you.\nPersuader: Are you sure? How many dollars do you spend everyday on pointless or unnecessary items, such as a candy bar or fast food?\n\tPersuadee: I'm sure. I work hard for money so I spend it the way I want.\nPersuader: These children have no way of earning money, as their countries are in shambles. Many die of hunger or preventable disease, up 5.6 million per year. Even 50 cents makes all the difference.\n\tPersuadee: I'm not interested in this charity.\nPersuader: Are you from the US?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I am\nPersuader: Are you aware of the US bombing civilian cities in developing countries?

You can refer to Save the Children's website to gather more information if you like to.   URL \n\tPersuadee: ooo ok...thats good that there is a organization put together to help children in other countries\nPersuader: Yes, it is good. But they are really under funded. Would you be willing to donate to the charity now?\n\tPersuadee: I will have to read up more about the organization before i just give my money up because there is fake charities in the world\nPersuader: I understand that. Your donation is essential to help ensuring children's rights to health, education, safety, etc. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.\n\tPersuadee: Yes i understand that because every sunday i would go to the homeless shelter in my town and help collect clothes for the people that need it.it is something i do once a week because it is the right thing to do..\nPersuader: It is the right thing to do. That helps people directly in your community. A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community. There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones. For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.

What do you think?\n\tPersuadee: I'm doing fine. I agree about the donation option.\nPersuader: I don't know much about the specific charity, but I'm a mom, and I think it's really important to help kids around the world.  From what I've heard, Save the Children is a great organization that really makes a different.  I've read they've been doing a lot of work in Syria. \n\tPersuadee: What charity are you talking about?\nPersuader: The info that I'm seeing on my end is that we can choose to donate part of what we earn in this task to Save the Children.  It's a large philanthropic organization that works on ensuring children's rights to health, education, and safety.  They have apparently done work recently to help children in Syria impacted by the civil war.  \n\tPersuadee: Do you know how long they've been around?\nPersuader: I don't see any exact date.  However, they have done work to improve access to education, medicine, and food in Darfur and appear to have been working when that area was also impacted by civil war.  \n\tPersuadee: Thanks, what are your contribution plans?\nPersuader: I am debating between 50% and all of the bonus.  So between 1 and 2 dollars.  I think even $1 can make a difference in their efforts.  What about you?\n\tPersuadee: I'm thinking about the same\nPersuader: I think that seems fair.  From the description, they seem to have a pretty low overhead so even $1 will go directly toward the charitable efforts.  They've also apparently been involved in Jimmy Carter's organization that seeks to give kids and families clean water by getting rid of the guinea worm.  The water filters they use only cost $.90\n\tPersuadee: Thanks for those details, I'd give a dollar to help.\nPersuader: Sounds like a good plan. So that $1 will be deducted from the payment.  My instructions say the research team will send all the donations directly.\n\tPersuadee: OK, they're making it easy to help\nPersuader: Yes - I think that's nice.

I just got in to work so we will see how things go today!\nPersuader: Hopefully it will be a good day :) Do you mind if I ask what kind of work you do?\n\tPersuadee: I actually work for a local television station in the middle of America.\nPersuader: Oh wow that sounds fantastic! Were you ever involved in raising awareness about social issues? Like children in need?\n\tPersuadee: I've donated to a few charities before, but I've never been personally involved myself.\nPersuader: I think you have a great platform for raising awareness so more people can donate to the cause\n\tPersuadee: That's true. I supposed I am in a good position. Unfortunately, I kind of just have a desk job, and don't really have anything to do with the news that is broadcast.\nPersuader: Well nothing is lost there, you can maybe persuade some co-workers to bring it up higher in the chain. A few years back I was in India and even though I was mesmerized by the beauty of its rich culture I was overly sad to see many children in the streets who looked utterly malnutritioned and were begging in the streets. It broke my heart. So much so that I got involved with a few charities to help children around the world.\n\tPersuadee: Oh that's great!! I wish I had more time to travel and more money to give. I love the feeling when you know you're actually helping someone else.\nPersuader: Its a great feeling. Especially now that I myself am a parent, I get even more depressed to see that in 2018, there are millions of children who suffer especially those in war zones. But you know, every little cent helps. You don't have to give hundreds or thousands. I have also worked in Baghdad during the war, and there were children in the streets selling packs of gum just to get a few cents here and there so they can survive.\n\tPersuadee: Oh my God. That's truly awful to know that children have to experience that. I would love to find a way to donate, even if it was just a little bit.\nPersuader: Have you heard of \"Save the Children\" Charity? They do amazing wo? It only takes 77c a day to help provide shelter for refugees. They have many programs that you can participate in to help out.  \n\tPersuadee: Oh that's awesome!! What kind of programs do they provide?\nPersuader: They target many causes. They provide education to teach children important skills. They also provide the best health and nutrition programs. They have a protection program and even programs for natural disaster areas. Imagine if 77c a day can provide shelter what would $1 or $2 dollars do?\n\tPersuadee: That's such a good point. Unfortunately, I'm in a really bad position monetarily right now. Is there any way I could donate even just a little bit?\nPersuader: You are very kind, but like I said every little thing helps. How much would you feel comfortable to donate to the charity?\n\tPersuadee: Maybe 20 cents? I know that's not a lot, but it's all I can afford for the next couple days.\nPersuader: Can you make it maybe 77c? Atleast you will feel good knowing that you are helping in providing shelter to these poor refugees.Your donation will be direclt deducted from your task payment but imagine what 77c would do for a child with no home...\n\tPersuadee: OK, I can donate 77 ceents\nPersuader: Perfect!!!!!! Thank you so so much! Imagine what a great gift you have just provided. May you be blessed always! And I hope, one day you will be able to raise awareness and have more people join in with the cause to save the children.

Have you heard of the Save The Children organization?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I have. Can you tell me how much of the donation actually reaches the children in need?\nPersuader: Save the Children donates nearly 90% of every dollar to their mission.  They are very upfront with letting you know where your donation is going.\n\tPersuadee: Can I choose where my donation is sent to?\nPersuader: Yes not only are you able to choose.  You have the ability to take part in their Sponsor A Child program by either choosing someone in the US or in another country.  I love the idea of staying connected to one or two so that i can see the progress and how I can specifically make a difference.\n\tPersuadee: Do I have to make recurring payments?\nPersuader: There's multiple ways to make payments.  Although recurring payments are recommended, it is completely optional.  Would you consider Sponsoring a Child on a long term basis during college?\n\tPersuadee: Possibly. I'm not sure if I can afford a long term plan.\nPersuader: The great thing about Save the Children they have the option to even send a gift such as a water kit, a soccer ball and even a rabbit.  I really like this idea because it makes it not all about the money.\n\tPersuadee: That's very nice, I like the idea of sending food or water.\nPersuader: Yes, it is so sad that we have children that still are in need of food and water.  As a single parent of 5 children, I know how rough it can get to provide even the basics but I am still moved to help others because of my own experiences.

Are you a real person or a software?\nPersuader: I am a real person just trying to help\n\tPersuadee: That is awesome, I was just wondering.

In the village where we were helping, I learned that starving children were sent up to 5 miles away to gather water for their families while their parents worked in the fields\n\tPersuadee: It bothers me a lot, I try to do my bits, mostly trying to raise awareness, but it is far from enough.

I know it's hard to believe but it's true, I've seen it first hand. Plus, by donating it to a place as credible as Save the Children, you know its going where its needed.\n\tPersuadee: Do you know if there is any research done on that? I do believe that you speak the truth, but it would be easier to convince people with actual numbers. I legitimately believe that amassing too much money is wrong, and mathematically it is ridiculous,  the owner of amazon donating half of his wealth would be the same as each person in the world donating 10 dollars. And he would still be 80 billion dollars rich.\nPersuader: Absolutely, I understand.

Literally 0.1% of Bezos's wealth. Sorry, I'm very salty about this, but you get the point.\nPersuader: Of course, I understand. The rich stay rich. But, not to be pushy, would you like to donate any of the money you would receive for this HIT to this organization?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, it doesn't make sense to complain and not to donate.

What are some of the things that this charity does that you think is special and unique?\nPersuader: It helps children have a better life and teaches them to be productive and self-sufficient.\n\tPersuadee: That's interesting. What all does it provide children with? Just food and clothes and education? Is it focused on 3rd world countries or specific economies?\nPersuader: It is focused on third world countries and it helps provide them some safety.  A good mind is a terrible thing to waste.\n\tPersuadee: I agree. What about vaccinations? Does it help kids get up to date with those? Providing education to children is important, but vaccines are as well. Preventative for certain diseases. \nPersuader: Yes it does provide vaccines that help them live longer.  You do want the helpless children to have a chance?\n\tPersuadee: Of course I do. I think anyone with a sound mind would want to provide children with a better chance at life. Is this like a sponsorship where you get a photos and information on how it's helping a specific child or is it divided up?\nPersuader: Yes, you can get a picture of the child you are sponcing and information about that child.\n\tPersuadee: I think that is great! Is there a website?\nPersuader: Yes there is a website.  Please feel free to peruse the SAVE THE CHILDREN'S website.  I think we should all contribute when we have an opportunity like this.\n\tPersuadee: I agree entirely. Have you contributed to a child in need through the charity?\nPersuader: Not through this charity but I have contribute 50% of what ever I am earning for worthy causes.  It is the right thing to do.\n\tPersuadee: 50% seems to be a lot of money considering economies\nPersuader: Please you not make a 50% donation for a worthy cause.  It will not really even effect you pocket.  At least you have the opportunity to earn money, they do not.", "label": [[10, 111, "Statement"], [196, 288, "Statement"], [372, 395, "Other-Answer"], [463, 488, "Other-Answer"], [626, 717, "Other-Answer"], [898, 975, "Other-Answer"], [977, 1018, "Statement"], [1229, 1285, "Affirmative-Answer"], [1287, 1338, "Declarative-Yes/No-Question"], [1596, 1686, "Affirmative-Answer"], [1753, 1776, "Affirmative-Answer"], [1778, 1837, "Suggest"], [1839, 1910, "Statement"], [2013, 2037, "Negative-Answer"], [2042, 2107, "Statement"], [2110, 2138, "Statement"], [2271, 2313, "Statement"], [2315, 2376, "Statement"], [2215, 2270, "Request"]], "idx": 72}

This is the first one for me too. \nPersuader: Is it giving you an option to donate some of your earnings?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I saw that. What are you going to do about it?\nPersuader: It wants me to donate to Save the Children.  Any idea if that is a real charity?\n\tPersuadee: It sounds familiar, but I'm not a hundred percent sure if it is a legit charity. \nPersuader: Are you planning to donate part of your earnings to them?\n\tPersuadee: No. I can't afford to give part of my earnings to charity. \nPersuader: I know the feeling.  I'm on food stamps myself.  Rather feed my children than some radom ones.\n\tPersuadee: I have a sister and brother who are struggling and I often give them money. That is why I'm working on turks. I am a full time teacher and I need extra income. \nPersuader: Yeah, we need to pay our teachers more.  Children our or future.  A lot of people at your school get free lunches?\n\tPersuadee: Yes about 65% of the students receive either free or reduced lunches. \nPersuader: Obviously that should have said \"are our\".  Kinda embarrassed about that typo \n\tPersuadee: Yes, but that's OK.\nPersuader: I don\\'t have an \"end chat\" or continue button.  Do you?\n\tPersuadee: No I don't see that option. I think we have to chat for ten minutes. \nPersuader: LOL.  or not\n\tPersuadee: So we have to come up with an agreement to a donation. What is that about?\nPersuader: Oh, we do?\n\tPersuadee: It says we need to make a donation agreement\nPersuader: Oh, so it wants us both to donate the same amount or something?\n\tPersuadee: Are you willing to donate?  I'm not and if you're not then we should both agree not donate and move one with the survey.\nPersuader: Sounds like a plan.

Have you ever heard of Save the Children? \n\tPersuadee: of course, I didn't see that detail. \nPersuader: In case you didn't know, they are an international organization that promotes children's rights and provides relief and helps support children in developing countries. \n\tPersuadee: you must be a fan. I assume you are going to donate.\nPersuader: Yes, I support this charity and yes, I will.

I personally love cold weather.\nPersuader: Yeah I do to, I can't wait for the snow to fly here :)  Just a quick question to find out a little more about you.  Have you given to any charities lately?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I have. I dontate to the Red Cross regularly.\nPersuader: I do as well and wish many more people would.  I like that they and a lot of other charities are utilizing the technology to make donations a lot easier.\n\tPersuadee: Yes they certainly are. I always donate online now.\nPersuader: Good for you!  Okay have you hear about any charities lately that have been doing extra due to the wars in which civilians are unfortunately in the wrong place with little help?\n\tPersuadee: No I don't think I've heard about any of those.\nPersuader: Let me give you an example for instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence. In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.\n\tPersuadee: Wow that sounds pretty bad\nPersuader: Yeah a lot of people are unaware of exactly what is going on in this messed up world.  I wish the media would actually do more to help out.  This is when a charity steps in specifically Save the Children Foundation.\n\tPersuadee: That would definitley be very helpfil\nPersuader: Today, together we can help this charity out.  Would you be willing to donate some or all of the money you would get for doing this task?\n\tPersuadee: Not right now I can't\nPersuader: Is there anything you have purchased this week that is not a neccessity?\n\tPersuadee: Not really. Just food and stuff.\nPersuader: Well maybe not just last week but how about all year.  What do we waste our time and money on?  I understand we all need to make money, but why can't people help out the people that truly need our help in this world.  If you donate $2.00 today I will match that.  Then we will have done our good deed for the day and maybe just maybe the universe will reward us in another way!\n\tPersuadee: I don't think I've really wasted much money lately.\nPersuader: Okay thats fine do you still wish to donate for karma to kick in?", "label": [[11, 39, "Conventional-Opening"], [15, 39, "Open-Question"], [83, 97, "Other-Answer"], [118, 154, "WH-Question"], [98, 115, "Open-Question"], [273, 324, "Agreement"], [329, 386, "Statement"], [389, 428, "YesNo-Question"], [503, 548, "Statement"], [503, 515, "Acknowledge"], [550, 656, "Statement"], [731, 745, "Acknowledge"], [747, 909, "YesNo-Question"], [981, 1100, "Statement"], [1101, 1214, "Statement"], [981, 1008, "Request"], [1265, 1350, "Agreement"], [1352, 1404, "Statement"], [1406, 1480, "Statement"], [1541, 1589, "Statement"], [1589, 1679, "YesNo-Question"], [1725, 1797, "YesNo-Question"], [1909, 1948, "Open-Question"], [1854, 1907, "Statement"], [1854, 1884, "Acknowledge"], [1949, 2071, "Statement"], [2072, 2116, "Statement"], [2118, 2231, "Statement"], [2307, 2322, "Acknowledge"], [2323, 2372, "YesNo-Question"]], "idx": 76}
