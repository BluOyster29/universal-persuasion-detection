I drank half of it and threw the rest away. ,1
So you can confirm you'd like to donate $5?,1
Here's a link from a charity watchdog group.,1
Save the Children actually has 86% of the money that is donated directly helping the children.,1
And you're making my job easy! ,1
Hello!,0
I like to match the donation with my partner on these hits when possible.,1
What type of charities do you donate to? ,1
day's,0
Make a donation on our website or have a monthly payment deducted from your banking account.,1
" but countries like Italy or Japan are experiencing a population shift. Even in countries like USA and France, more doctors and scientists are retiring than graduating. So we need kids to supplement all of those areas",1
i would like to help and save the childrens to the organization..,1
How much do you think would be able to spare?,1
Hello. have you ever heard about Save the Children charity?,1
"I read that in the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in the violence in Syria.",1
He went through a TON of testing and that's how they caught it.,1
I really thank you for thinking about donating.,1
What country are you from?  What are your feelings about this topic?,1
It\'s an organization that provides relief to children in developing countries and promotes their rights.,1
so will you donate to keep the children nourished and kept safe,1
" I believe they've been around for almost 100 years, so hopefully they have a pretty effecient organization. I completely understand that some expenses do occur in a non-profit, but with 90% going directly to the children, I feel pretty good about it.",0
I'm sorry--I don't quite understand the amount you are suggesting.,0
"Hello, I would like to talk to you about making a donation to Save the Children",1
How much would you like to give?,1
 m,1
 ,0
do you know how is the save the children,1
The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.,0
"All across the globe, children are dying from preventable causes, missing out on education due to poverty or gender, suffering from violence, exploitation and neglect, and are vulnerable in times of crisis.",1
"Hello, may I ask if you already cooperate with a nonprofit organization",1
The money will have a large impact.,1
The total donation amount for each of us would be $2.00. ,1
Remember to pass along our info to friends and family.,1
Our independently audited financial statements consistently show that nearly 9 out of every 10 dollars we spend goes to programs and services for children and families in need.,1
"Well, any amount that you would like to offer would be greatly appreciated.  ",1
I'm doing pretty good too.,0
We millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.,1

Well i do ask for at least a small doation to Save the Children.,1
And such a small amount probably wouldn't hurt the pocketbook too badly.,1
That can provide a meal for a kid,1
I would like you to donate at least half of your money doing this hit to save children its your moral obligation.,1
The research team will collect all donations and send it to Save the Children.,0
"Yea, I don't know.  I have a 10 min chat exchange but not seeing a submit or anything.  You?",0
We pretty much live paycheck to paycheck.,1
Would you consider making a donation from your task payment?,1
What do you think?,1
You can start off with donating $0.50?,1

"Food pantries? A lot of food worldwide comes from countries such as Zimbabwe or Haiti (countries that work with Save the Children). Right now there's famine, but by donating it will ultimately increase the worldwide food, and reduce the need for food pantries as a whole. Even though it's marketed at children, it's moreso helping the areas that have a high child poverty rate",0
" I hope you don't consider yourself to be a Christian, the hypocrisy would be laughable",1
Do you frequently donate? what about children's charity?,1
