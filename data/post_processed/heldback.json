The poor are barely left to survive while the rich get richer. It's a sad truth.\nPersuader:  There is nothing morally wrong with the rich getting richer. In the last 10 years those rich people have invested in the global trade system and brought over a billion people out of the world poverty threshold. In the world there is an elite segment of the population that provides most of the value for society, they should be the ones with the lion share of the resources. This is because the only way they can obtain a large amount of wealth in the first place is to make hundreds, thousands, and millions of mutually beneficial transactions.\n\tPersuadee: That's a valid point.

Do these corporations donate money, goods, or volunteer time?\nPersuader: Some corporations, like TJMaxx help out through large amounts of funding, or they contribute in other ways. For example, TOMS has an ongoing program that donates a pair of TOMS to children in need for every pair sold and Accenture works with them to explore technologies to help survive, learn, and be protected. \n\tPersuadee: That's very fitting to those brands and their own focus/expertise.

{"index": 630, "text": "Persuader: Good morning. I am looking to raise money for the charity Save the Children and I was wondering if you might beinterested?\n\tPersuadee: I have been reading articles about Save the Children charity and I find them quite interesting.\nPersuader: They are a really good charity. [ <s> For instance, they have been helping families trapped in the Syrian conflict. <e> 5-AUTHORITY | 3-EMOTION ] Did you realize that 1000 children with killed or injured the first 2 months of this year in Syria? Anything you can donate will go help a family avoid these situations.\n\tPersuadee: I think this is quite interesting. I have read that 86% of the funds raised go directly to benefiting the children. I also think it is very interesting that a woman is President & CEO. I think this is great because not to often are woman CEO's. This speaks volumes in my opinion to the donors.\nPersuader: [ <s> You are correct. <e> 1-RAPPORT | 8-NO-PERSUASION ] The charity has low administrative overhead, meaning most of the money goes to helping children in dire situations. [ <s> It is also important that a woman heads a major charity likes this. <e> 2-NEGOTIATE | 3-EMOTION ] She can bring a different perspective to the charity that might not be seen in another chairty. [ <s> I can tell you already know a lot about this charity and the good work they are doing! <e> 2-NEGOTIATE | 1-RAPPORT ]\n\tPersuadee: I feel a know a good bit about charities. I am disappointed in the salaries of the CEO, Executive VP & VP. I think a half million dollars that the CEO is compensated is a bit much. These dollars could be used to help more children. \nPersuader: [ <s> You won't hear me argue with that, <e> 1-RAPPORT | 8-NO-PERSUASION ] [ <s> but the fact is to attract qualified people to run a major charity is a costly endeavor. <e> 4-LOGIC | 4-LOGIC | 2-NEGOTIATE ] For example, the head of the Human Rights Campaign makes $600,000 a year and I think we can agree this charity has a much wider scope. It is unfortunate that these salaries have to be paid and not go to the children, but we also need people running the charity who can actually make an impact on saving the children.\n\tPersuadee: I agree that a qualified person is needed to run such a charity. I think my biggest concern when salaries get so high they lose focus of what the organization is needing to do. We all like money! I think that this organization is a very good organization and have competent people running it. There are so many children charities that you really have to study each one to be able to decide who you would want to make your donation to. Are you a donor of Save the Children charity?\nPersuader: Yes and I also donate to UNICEF. [ <s> What I like about both programs are the educational outreach they do. <e> 2-NEGOTIATE | 1-RAPPORT ] Most of these children would never have a chance to get an education and Save the Children serves millions of children in this area. Not only does the child get an education they would otherwise not get, they also get basic healthcare and nutrition thrown in as well. The dollar you spend truly does go a long way to helping others! \n\tPersuadee: Absolutely true of Save the Children. I always look at how many children have been helped and what they help the children with. I then look at the overall salaries of the organization (petty maybe) but I need to make sure in my heart that the money I donate is going to help children not the management, even though I know a portion goes to them. I am willing to make a donation to the great cause.\nPersuader: [ <s> If it helps you, Charity Navigator gives them 3 out of 4 stars. <e> 5-AUTHORITY | 4-LOGIC ] [ <s> As you probably know there are very few charities that have a 4 star rating <e> 5-AUTHORITY | 4-LOGIC ].

It's hard to come up with a bunch of conversation about charity. It's easy to just live in your own world and not think about the horrible things in the world.

It is the scariest thing that can happen to anyone especially a child. Once I saw how many children were fighting cancer and other serious disease it woke me up to what is important in life and just because we are not going through it there are so many children suffering that the least I can do is donate.\n\tPersuadee: That is a great way to think about it. I'm sure that when I have kids, my thinking will change a lot as well. So I think that we should donate .10 each to the children. What do you think?\nPersuader: [ <s> Yes I am fine with that <e> 2-NEGOTIATE | 4-LOGIC ]\n\tPersuadee: It is a small amount, but I think that every penny can make a lot of difference.

{"index": 972, "text": "Persuader: How do you feel about childrens charities? Do you feel like they do good work and are important to society?\n\tPersuadee: I believe that childrens charity is very much needed in society. We see children going through difficult times including things like cancer and several other illnesses that are life-threatening. I do have a soft spot for children. As a parent of one, I woudn't want to see my child go through many of the hardships that children of very young age would go through. I think it's crucial to tell whether these charities are in fact going towards children in need. Parents who don't have the necessary financial support to provide their children with the care they need.\nPersuader: [ <s> I totally agree - I have a young child and when I see images of children starving or suffering it really makes me want to help out however I can. <e> 3-EMOTION | 1-RAPPORT ] I can't imagine living in a place where I had to worry about my child dying from hunger or human rights abuses.

In fact, I've recently did some research on this charity and found so many community events that help children in general. Whether it'd be for back-to-school supplies or changing the lives of bright children. One of the things that really touch my heart is preventing malnutrition. Millions of children die each year due to poor health and so having a nutrition program, ensure's that children will grow up healthy.\nPersuader: It is always shocking to me how far charities can make money go to help enrich the lives of children. [ <s> You would not think that something as simple as skipping a cup of morning coffee to donate to a charity would be able to make such a huge impact in the life of a child, but it really does. <e> 3-EMOTION | 4-LOGIC ] I think that if more people realized how giving up a little in our lives could save the life of a child that more people would participate in charity. Do you think that is true?\n\tPersuadee: I believe it could be true. However, I think a lot of people would question whether these charities are legitimate. One thing that people would look upon is proof of legitimacy. If they can see for themselves and or participate in some kind of a charity event, then they would want to contribute to this.\nPersuader: I agree. [ <s> It is so important to do your research when deciding to support a charity. <e> 4-LOGIC | 5-AUTHORITY ] It is sad that there are charities that pop up that end up using more of the funds for their own needs rather than a legitimate one like Save the children that has verifiable credentials and obvious international impact. Do you think charities should be more transparent about how they will be using the funds?\n\tPersuadee: Personally, transparency is especially vital. When you become so passionate about something like this, you would want the world to become more involved in this passion of yours. In turn, they would have an idea of the tribulations that others go through, as well as, becoming more sympathetic towards society in general. If you have nothing to hide then this would not be a problem. \nPersuader: I agree. [ <s> I prefer to know that the donation I am making big or small is actually going to be going to a trustable fund. <e> 1-RAPPORT | 5-AUTHORITY ] Do you think that people who have the ability to help have a moral obligation to do so? \n\tPersuadee: Honestly, it should be a choice. I don't think of it as a moral obligation, necessarily. However, I think people should open their eyes to things like this because if they really look at the big picture and find that it could possibly affect their lives in the future then they should be more involved and play a role in helping others.\nPersuader: [ <s> I think looking at the big picture is a good way to see it. <e> 3-EMOTION | 1-RAPPORT ] [ <s> I believe that most people would make a choice to help with what they could without any sense of guilt or obligation. <e> 1-RAPPORT | 3-EMOTION | 1-RAPPORT | 6-SOCIAL ] [ <s> I think most people would help just to help. <e> 3-EMOTION | 6-SOCIAL ] Do you think people are fundamentally eager to help with what they can like that?  \n\tPersuadee: I think so. Depending on their financial standpoint, I think people would contribute to a charity like this if they have the funds to do so. If they don't, it's completely understandable. In many places, living expenses are very expensive so they may or may not be able to. However, every cent counts. It wouldn't matter how big or how small the donation is. It's all about giving.\nPersuader: [ <s> I think that would be a more effective message sometimes. <e> 1-RAPPORT | 3-EMOTION | 1-RAPPORT ] Some people may think that they need to be wealthy in order to contribute, that their $5 donation could not possibly do anything to help.

[ <s> Or do you think that people would feel like microdonations would not be effective no matter what? <e> 1-RAPPORT | 3-EMOTION | 1-RAPPORT ]?\n\tPersuadee: Those are very good questions. It depends on the way they see it. Those who believe in the gift of giving and are generous regardless of the price then a small donation could count as much as a $100 donation could. Nonetheless, if your views are small and you only look at these donations at a high price, then small donations wouldn't count for anything. Overall, I feel any donation is acceptable and could count towards a good meal for a child. \nPersuader: I think a lot of people who do not have an extra $100 would still be willing to donate a small amount to a charity like save the children, if they had an easy way to do it.[ <s>  At the grocery store sometimes they will ask if I want to round up to the nearest dollar amount and donate that increase in change to charity.  <e> 1-RAPPORT | 6-SOCIAL ]Do you think most people say yes to this? Or they would usually say maybe next time\n\tPersuadee: Personally, I always round it up to the nearest dollar for any charity I feel connected to. I have seen a lot of people do the same. I think some people will say \"maybe next time\" if they aren\\'t paying attention when the cashier asked them this question and/or they don\\'t have the funds to do so.
